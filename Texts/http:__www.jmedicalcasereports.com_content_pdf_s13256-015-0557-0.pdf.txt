Abstract 

Introduction 

Rapid  scale-up  of  antiretroviral  therapy  rollout  in  Sub-Saharan  African  countries  faces  the 
challenge of virological failure. This  could be the consequence of transmitted drug-resistant 
human  immunodeficiency  virus  strains  at  the  population  level.  While  a  pre-antiretroviral 
therapy  genotypic  test  has  been  a  major  component  of  the  human  immunodeficiency  virus 
management  programme  in  developed  nations,  it  is  yet  to  be  incorporated  into  the 
antiretroviral therapy programme in resource-poor countries. 

Case presentation 

A  32-year-old  Black  African  woman  was  seen  for  her  six-month  routine  review.  Her  viral 
load after initiation of fixed drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz was 
31,397  RNA  copies/mL.  Adherence  was  assessed  to  be  good  based  on  pharmacy  pick-up 
dates,  on-time  clinic  appointment  records,  medical  file  review,  self-reporting  and  treatment 
supporter’s report. Her viral load was repeated after another two months of close monitoring; 
the  result  showed  viral  load  of  31,159  RNA  copies/mL.  She  was  assessed  as  virological 
failure  to  her  first-line  antiretrovirals  and  commenced  on  second-line  antiretrovirals: 
zidovudine/lamivudine/Aluvia®  (lopinavir  and  ritonavir).  A  human  immunodeficiency  virus 
drug  genotypic  testing  showed  she  was  only  susceptible  to  zidovudine  and  protease 
inhibitors. At third month on the new regimen, her viral load was suppressed. 

Conclusions 

This  case  report  demonstrates  the  possibility  of  a  silent  epidemic  within  the  human 
immunodeficiency virus pandemic in resource-poor settings like Eastern Cape, South Africa. 
We  described  a  case  of  early  virological  failure  in  a  highly  motivated  young  woman. 
Although,  a  pre-antiretroviral  therapy  genotypic  test  is  yet  to  be  incorporated  into  a  human 
immunodeficiency virus programme in resource-poor countries, the need for it might become 
evident as the programme expands. Close monitoring of the viral load of patients according 
to national guidelines will enable early detection of a failing regimen and prompt intervention 
can be instituted to prevent morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need to strengthen the 
human  immunodeficiency  virus  programme  in  resource-poor  countries  to  prevent  the 
emergence  of  an  epidemic  of  transmitted  drug-resistant  human  immunodeficiency  virus 
strains within the existing human immunodeficiency virus pandemic.

Introduction 

According  to  the  2013  Global  Report  of  the  Joint  United  Nations  Programme  on  HIV  and 
AIDS  (UNAIDS),  35.3  million  people  were  living  with  human  immunodeficiency  virus 
(HIV)  by  the  end  of  2012  and  70.8%  of  the  global  burden  reside  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa. 
South  Africa  has  the  highest  burden  of  the  HIV  epidemic  (6.4  million  people  living  with 
HIV/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome)  [1].  The  global  response  to  the  epidemic  has 
seen more than 60% of eligible individuals already initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
using  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  criteria  of  2010  (CD4  count  ≤350  cells/mL)  and 
approximately 34% using WHO 2013 criteria (CD4 count ≤500 cells/mL) [2]. 

The  impact  of  the  scale-up  of  ART  includes  4.2  million  deaths  averted,  800,000  child 
infections averted with  the Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV programme 
and  a  decrease  in  the  incidence  of  HIV  infections  in  2012  [2].  The  probable  challenges  of 
rapid  scale-up  of  ART  include  loss  to  follow  up,  virological  failures  and  drug  resistance 
(acquired and transmitted). These have not been fully investigated in resource-poor settings; 
however,  their  possibility  has  been  documented  [3]. While  acquired  resistance  has  received 
attention in the national programmes of most resource-poor countries of Sub-Saharan Africa 
[4], transmitted resistance has not received similar attention. 

This  is  the  first  case  report  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge  to  describe  a  patient  who 
experienced  a  primary  virological  failure  possibly  secondary  to  transmitted  drug-resistant 
HIV (TDRHIV) strain in Eastern Cape, South Africa. 

Case presentation 

Six  months  ago,  a  32-year-old  Black  African  woman  was  seen  for  her  routine  review.  She 
was asymptomatic. Approximately 13 to 14 months earlier, she was referred to our HIV Unit 
because  of  a  low  CD4  count  for  ART  initiation.  She  was  antiretroviral  (ARV)-naïve  with 
WHO  clinical  stage  3  (oral  candidiasis)  and  a  baseline  CD4  count  of  14  cells/mL.  Reflex 

laboratory  serum  Cryptococcal  Latex  Antigen  Test  serology  was  negative.  The  results  of 
other baseline investigations were within normal limits. Her symptom screen for tuberculosis 
was negative. Alcohol and substance use were excluded. There was no history of depression 
or  any  comorbid  chronic  illnesses.  She  disclosed  her  status  to  her  partner.  She  was 
nulliparous. 

Her  medications  during  preparation  for  ARVs  included  co-trimoxazole,  multivitamins  and 
oral  nystatin.  She  was  commenced  on  a  fixed  dose  combination  of  tenofovir,  emtricitabine 
and  efavirenz  daily  (according  to  the  South  African  National  Department  of  Health 
Guideline,  2013)  [4].  She  was  followed  up  at  2,  4  and  8  weeks  for  immune  reconstitution 
inflammatory  syndrome  and  adverse  effects.  At  each  visit,  adherence  was  reviewed  and 
further  counselling  was  provided.  Isoniazid  prophylaxis  was  initiated;  her  estimated 
glomerular  filtration  rate  was  normal  at 
three  months  (glomerular  filtration  rate 
>60mL/minute/1.73m2). 

She  was  again  reviewed  at  six  months  in  2014:  viral  load  (VL)  of  31,397  ribonucleic  acid 
(RNA) copies/mL; a log value of 4 was obtained. Poor adherence was considered despite her 
and  the  treatment  supporter’s  account  of  good  adherence.  A  thorough  evaluation  of  the 
medical  files  for  clinic  attendance,  pharmacy  records  for  pick-up  of  medications  and  pill 
count  charts  was  conducted.  She  was  deemed  to  have  a  relatively  good  adherence.  There 
were  no  drug–drug  interactions;  no  herbal  or  alternative  therapies  were  used  during  the 
period  of  treatment.  She  was  not  treated  for  diarrhoea  or  vomiting  during  the  preceding  6 
months.  Further  questions  about  her  new  sexual  partner  and  HIV  status  of  previous  sexual 
partners  did  not  yield  any  new  information  and  she  had  not  been  sexually  active  since 
diagnosis of HIV. Adherence was consolidated for another two months with intense monthly 
review.  Her  VL  at  eight  month  remained  31,159  RNA  copies/mL  in  spite  of  excellent 
adherence.  We  confirmed  virological  failure.  An  assessment  of  a  probable  primary 
virological  failure  from  TDRHIV  was  considered.  A  decision  was  made  to  switch  to  a 
second-line  regimen  of  zidovudine  (AZT)/lamivudine/lopinavir  and  ritonavir  at  standard 
doses. 

After  analysing  the  case  we  decided  to  do  an  HIV  drug  genotypic  test  outside  the  National 
guideline to understand the pattern of resistant mutation in our patient. 

The genotypic test result showed susceptibility to protease inhibitors and AZT (Table 1).

The HIV subtype isolated in  the  genotypic testing  was subtype C. The K65R  mutation was 
noted as part of the nucleoside/nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor mutation; however, 
AZT remains active. 

She  was  reviewed  monthly  and  a  blood  sample  for  VL  was  taken  at  third  month  of 
commencing  second-line  ARVs.  The  result  confirmed  viral  suppression  (VL=25  RNA 
copies/mL). She is presently doing well. 

The timeline of the case is shown in Figure 1.

Discussion 

The case report suggests the possibility of yet another epidemic that may be emanating from 
the HIV pandemic; awareness of its existence is a reality in resource-poor countries. Whether 
our case represents a part of the rising prevalence of TDRHIV remains uncertain. A pre-ART 
genotypic test is a prerequisite for initiation of treatment in resource-rich nations [5], whereas 
a genotypic test is reserved for second-line regimen failures in resource-constrained settings 
like  ours  [4,6,7].  The  difference  between  the  two  models  of  HIV  care  could  result  in  a 
minimum  of  ≥eight  months’  delay  in  initiating  effective  ART  in  patients  with  TDRHIV 
which was the case in this patient. 

The two VLs taken according to the South African ART guideline [4] confirmed virological 
failure. What remains applicable in our practice setting is the role of VL monitoring, which 
was  adhered  to  strictly  in  our  patient.  Hence,  VL  monitoring  may  remain  the  only  tool  to 
determine  early  ARV  failure  in  the  resource-poor  setting  where  we  practice.  However,  it  is 
worth noting that TDRHIV is one of the documented causes of virological failure on a first-
line  regimen  [8]  which  is  a  possibility  in  this  patient.  Safe  sexual  practice  should  be 
advocated  in  all  patients  to  prevent  the  spread  of  TDRHIV  strains  at  a  community  level 
[9,10]. Of importance in our patient is her being ARV naïve with no past obstetrics history. 

Similar  to  a  meta-analysis  conducted  by  Gupta  et  al.,  our  patient  has  acquired  many 
mutations  (Table  1)  [11].  However,  we  found  that  she  remained  susceptible  to  AZT  as 
mutations  found  in  combination  with  K65R  in  our  case  enhance  susceptibility  to  AZT 
(M184V as well as K65R) [12]. Therefore, we expect that AZT would remain active against 
such viruses. The latest VL of 25 RNA copies/mL from her confirmed an effective ART after 
an initial delay of 8 months. 

Limitations of current practice 

It remains a challenge that a pre-ART genotypic resistance testing could not be undertaken in 
patients  with  HIV  infection  in  a  resource-constrained  setting  as  this  would  have  provided 
information  on  the  baseline  ARV  drug  resistance.  Also,  the  inability  to  conduct  ARV  drug 
levels in the partner of the patient should be noted. 

Conclusions 

Although,  a  pre-ART  genotypic  test  is  yet  to  be  incorporated  into  an  HIV  programme  in 
resource-poor  countries,  the  need  for  its  incorporation  into  clinical  care  may  become  more 
evident  as  the  prevalence  of  TDR  rises.  Meanwhile,  close  monitoring  of  VL  of  patients 
according  to  the  national  guidelines  is  very  important.  This  will  enable  early  detection  of  a 
failing regimen and prompt intervention can be instituted to prevent accumulation of resistant 
strains, virological failure, morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need to strengthen the 
HIV  programme  in  resource-poor  settings  to  prevent  the  emergence  of  a  silent  epidemic  of 
TDRHIV within the HIV pandemic.
