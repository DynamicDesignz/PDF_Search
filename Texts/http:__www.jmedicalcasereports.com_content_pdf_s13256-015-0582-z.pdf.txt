Abstract 
Introduction 

A rare complication of chronic pancreatitis is the formation of single or multiple mediastinal 
pseudocysts,  which  are  fueled  from  the  pancreas  through  anatomical  openings  of  the 
diaphragm.  We  present  a  rare  case  with  a  difficult  diagnosis,  treatment  and  potentially 
catastrophic complications. 

Case presentation 

A  53-year-old  Caucasian  man  was  referred  to  our  hospital  for  further  investigation  and 
treatment of a large heterogeneous mass situated in the posterior mediastinum, and bilateral 
pleural effusions which had developed after recent multiple episodes of pancreatitis. He had a 

history of chronic alcoholism. Laboratory and imaging modalities established the diagnosis of 
a pancreatic mediastinal pseudocyst. 

Conclusions 

Despite  successful  initial  conservative  treatment,  our  patient  had  a  relapse  and  underwent 
emergency surgical intervention due to internal hemorrhage. We present his diagnostic and 
imaging  workup,  along  with  the  multidisciplinary  intervention,  and  a  literature  review 
referring to the diagnosis and treatment of mediastinal pancreatic pseudocysts.

Introduction 
One  of  the  most  common  complications  of  chronic  pancreatitis  is  the  development  of 
pseudocysts due to stenosis or disruption of the pancreatic duct. These can be numerous and 
their size varies from a few centimeters to 30cm in some cases. They are rich in enzymes and 
are held together by fibrous and granulomatous tissue, hence the term pseudocyst. In some 
cases they can invade adjacent organs, such as the liver [1,2] and spleen [3], and sometimes 
may extend above the diaphragm. 

We herein present a patient with a history of alcohol abuse who was referred to our hospital 
for further investigation and treatment of a mass in the posterior mediastinum, and bilateral 
pleural effusions, which had developed after recent multiple episodes of pancreatitis. 
Case presentation 
A 53-year-old Caucasian man with a past medical history of recurrent pancreatitis for the last 
18 months, depression, alcohol and tobacco abuse, was referred to our hospital after a 10-day 
hospitalization  in  a  pulmonary  clinic,  where  he  was  admitted  due  to  dyspnea  and  two 
episodes  of  hemoptysis.  An  extensive  workup  had  already  been  performed,  including 
bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, chest and upper abdomen computed tomography (CT) scans. A 
diagnostic paracentesis had already been carried out and fluid samples were sent for further 
analysis.  His  upper  gastrointestinal  endoscopy  and  bronchoscopy  did  not  show  any 
remarkable findings, and his pleural fluid was plenteous in protein and amylase. His cytology 
reports  were  negative  for  malignancy  and  his  pleural  fluid  adenosine  deaminase  levels 
showed  no  evidence  of  mycobacterial  infection  (Table  1).  He  had  a  good  clinical  status, 
except for a mild shortness of breath on exertion. He reported no fever or chills and, despite 
having a good appetite the last six months, he noted a weight loss of 25kg. Additionally, he 
mentioned that over the last four months he had experienced difficulty in swallowing solid 
food. On admission, his physical examination revealed bilateral diminished breath sounds at 
the lung basis and a firm liver edge 5cm below the right costal margin. His laboratory results 
showed anemia,  malnutrition  and slightly elevated serum amylase (360U/L) (Table 1). His 
chest  CT  scan  revealed  bilateral  pleural  effusions  and  a  mass  in  the  lower  mediastinum 
(Figure  1);  these  radiological  findings  were  not  present  on  his  previous  examinations  nine 

months ago (Figure 2). After a successful chest drainage clinical improvement was noticed, 
however, further chest CT imaging showed a longitudinal fluid collection in the mediastinum, 
along  the  lower  esophagus,  measuring  3×8cm  (Figure  3A,  B).  This  collection  extended 
beyond the diaphragm and seemed to be connected with a small pseudocyst at the pancreatic 
tail  (Figure  4).  He  was  on  a  specific  enteral  diet,  lipase  supplementation  and  octreotide 
(administered 
resonance 
cholangiopancreatography  showed  the  pancreatic  duct  to  be  slightly  dilated.  No  further 
interventions were performed at that time. A month later he was discharged in good clinical 
status and scheduled for outpatient observation.

Figure  1  Axial  post-contrast  computed  tomography  scan  at  the  level  of  the  lower 
mediastinum reveals a mass (arrow) and bilateral pleural effusions (arrow heads). 

Figure 2 Nine months earlier, an axial post-contrast computed tomography scan reveals no 
abnormality  in  the  mediastinum.  A  small  pleural  effusion  is  present  at  the  left  hemithorax 
(arrow). 

Figure  3  Post-contrast  chest  computed  tomography  scan  after  successful  pleural  drainage. 
Panel A: Fluid collection (*) in front of esophagus (arrow) and a small pleural effusion is 
present (arrow head). Panel B: Sagittal reconstructed images demonstrate a longitudinal fluid 
collection (* *) in the mediastinum, along the lower esophagus (arrow), measuring 3×8cm. 
The lesion was compatible with a mediastinum pseudocyst. 

Figure  4  Post-contrast  computed  tomography  scan  of  the  upper  abdomen  reveals  a  small 
pseudocyst of 2cm at the pancreatic tail (arrow). 

Two months after his discharge he was readmitted with clinical signs of respiratory distress 
and bilateral pleural effusion was visible on his radiology chest imaging. The results from his 
serum blood and pleural fluid laboratory tests were similar to his first admission. As similar 
findings were identified on his chest and abdomen CT scan compared to the images from his 
last  admission,  a  decision  for  surgical  intervention  was  made.  Upon  completion  of  the 
preoperative diagnostic workup he was transferred to the general surgery ward. He was on a 
triple antibiotic regimen (meropenem, vancomycin and fluconazole) and was scheduled for 
elective  surgery.  On  the  fourth  hospitalization  day  he  suffered  from  nausea,  vomiting  and 

abdominal pain. His physical exam showed that his abdomen was rigid, with noted pain on 
the  upper  abdomen  and  guarding.  His  laboratory  tests  showed  a  significant  drop  in  his 
hemoglobin level and his vital signs revealed borderline tachycardia. After resuscitation with 
fluids and blood transfusions, a CT scan of his abdomen was performed where an extended 
hematoma  at  the  lesser  sac  was  identified  with  no  active  bleeding.  Subsequently,  he 
underwent  an  elective  embolization  of  the  splenic  artery  followed  by  an  emergency 
laparotomy.  Intraoperatively,  a  sizable  hematoma  was  found  at  the  lesser  sac,  pushing  his 
stomach  anteriorly.  Due  to  chronic  inflammation  his  pancreas  was  fibrous  and  hard.  The 
splenic  vein  was  thrombosed  and  splenomegaly  with  left-sided  portal  hypertension  was 
present. A distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed; his post-operative course 
was uneventful and he was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. 
Discussion 
Tumors that are most commonly located in the posterior mediastinum are of esophageal and 
nervous  origin.  Hernias,  aortic  aneurysms  and  duplication  cysts  can  also  be  found  in  this 
anatomic area. Some cases of extramedullary hematopoiesis [4] and pancreatic pseudocysts 
are  also  reported  in  the  literature.  After  a  rupture  of  the  posterior  pancreatic  duct,  the 
pancreatic fluid is usually confined in the retroperitoneal space, but can occasionally slip into 
the posterior mediastinum from the esophageal or the aortic hiatus, leading to the formation 
of pseudocysts. If the diaphragm is penetrated through the inferior vena cava hiatus or the 
foramen of Morgagni, the pseudocyst will be formed in the middle and anterior mediastinum, 
respectively [5]. Published data report that these cysts can occur at any age from 7 months to 
73  years,  and  the  leading  cause  in  adults  is  chronic  alcoholic  pancreatitis  and  trauma  in 
children [6]. The related symptoms may vary from chest pain, palpitations, dysphagia, pleural 
effusion  with  concomitant  dyspnea,  cough  and  hemoptysis,  to  severe  life-threatening 
complications such as hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, esophagobronchial fistula and acute 
airway obstruction [7-10]. 

Computed  tomography  and  magnetic  resonance  imaging  are  the  most  commonly  used 
imaging  modalities  to  reveal  the  size,  location  and  possible  communications  of  the 
pseudocysts with the pancreas. Furthermore, magnetic resonance computed pancreatography 
in  conjunction  with  esophageal  retrograde  cholangiopancreatography  can  unveil  strictures 
and  disruption  of  the  pancreatic  duct.  A  transesophageal  fine  needle  aspiration  can  be 
performed when a differential diagnosis problem is raised, but the patient’s medical history 
and CT imaging study are usually adequate for the diagnosis to be established. 

The  management  of  a  mediastinal  pancreatic  pseudocyst  is  a  difficult  task.  Relapses  are 
common  and  procedural  complications  are  many.  At  the  moment  there  are  no  guidelines 
addressing this problem. A literature review revealed only a few scant reports of spontaneous 
resolution  [11,12],  but  in  the  vast  majority  of  cases  intervention  was  mandatory,  and  the 
approach has to be individually tailored. 

Conservative  treatment  with  strict  diet,  enzyme  supplementation  and  complete  abstinence 
from  alcohol  is  indicated  to  all  stable  patients.  In  addition,  bromhexine  hydrochloride  and 
somatostatin analogues have been used in a few cases [13-15]. Somatostatin and its analog 
octreotide are peptide hormones that inhibit the release of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, secretin, 
pancreozymin and pepsin. In our patient, octreotide was successfully administered at a dose 

of 0.5mg (administered subcutaneously), three times daily, for one month following his first 
admission. 

In certain cases, minimally invasive procedures can resolve the problem and help patients to 
avoid surgery. Patients with pancreatic duct disruption and stenosis can be treated with the 
placement of stents or with naso-pancreatic drainage, in order to restore the duct patency and 
seize  the  pseudocyst  fuelling.  For  other  patients  with  large  abdominal  pseudocysts  that 
communicate with the mediastinum, CT-guided abdominal percutaneous drainage may be the 
optimal treatment [16-20]. In our patient, the magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography 
showed no patency problems of the pancreatic duct, and the 2cm cyst beside the pancreatic 
tail  was  too  small  to  be  accessed  and  drained.  To  date,  surgery  with  or  without 
pancreatectomy  is  the  most  commonly  used  treatment,  alongside  internal  drainage  of  the 
stomach, or percutaneous drainage when applicable. 
Conclusions 
Mediastinal pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare complication of alcohol related pancreatitis, with 
potentially  catastrophic  complications  and  a  difficult  treatment  course.  A  multidisciplinary 
approach is mandatory for achieving an optimal outcome.
