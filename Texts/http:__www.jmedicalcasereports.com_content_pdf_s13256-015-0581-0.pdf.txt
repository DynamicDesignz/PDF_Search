Abstract 
Introduction 

Peripheral  nerve  hyperexcitability  disorders  are  characterized  by  constant  muscle  fiber 
activity. Acquired neuromyotonia manifests clinically in cramps, fasciculations, and stiffness. 
In  Morvan’s  syndrome  the  signs  of  peripheral  nerve  hyperexcitability  are  accompanied  by 
autonomic symptoms, sensory abnormalities, and brain disorders. 

Case presentation 

A  70-year-old  Caucasian  man  developed,  in  the  course  of  3  months,  polyneuropathy  with 
unpleasant  dysesthesia  of  lower  extremities  and  gradually  increasing  fasciculation,  muscle 
stiffness  and  fatigue.  Subsequently,  he  developed  a  prominent  insomnia  with  increasing 
psychological  changes  and  then  he  attempted  a  suicide.  Electromyography  confirmed  a 
sensory-motor polyneuropathy of a demyelinating type. The findings included fasciculation 
as  well  as  myokymia,  doublets  and  multiplets,  high  frequency  discharges,  and 
afterdischarges, following motor nerve stimulation. No auto-antibodies were found either in 
his  blood  or  cerebrospinal  fluid.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  of  his  brain  showed  small, 
unspecific,  probably  postischemic  changes.  A  diagnosis  of  Morvan’s  syndrome  was 
confirmed; 
intravenously,  and, 
subsequently, carbamazepine 2×200mg, venlafaxine 150mg, and mirtazapine each night were 
prescribed. His sleep improved, suicidal tendencies stopped, less fasciculations occurred, and 
muscle  hypertonia  also  improved.  Hyperexcitation  also  partially  remitted  including  the 
electromyography finding. 

immunoglobulin  (2g/kg  body  weight)  was  applied 

Conclusions 

We described here the case of a patient with Morvan’s syndrome; his case is rare because of 
severe  psychical  changes  with  a  suicide  attempt,  short  admission  to  a  psychiatric  ward, 
prominent  electromyographic  changes,  and  because  antibodies  were  not  detected.  After 
therapy with immunoglobulins followed by corticosteroids with sodium channel blocker, his 

motor,  autonomic,  psychical  signs  and  symptoms,  and  electromyography  changes 
substantially improved.

Introduction 
Peripheral  nerve  hyperexcitability  disorders  are  characterized  by  constant  muscle  fiber 
activity  due  to  hyperexcitability  in  the  distal  motor  axons  [1].  Acquired  neuromyotonia  is 
characterized  by  continual  ectopic  nerve  activity,  which  manifests  clinically  in  cramps, 
fasciculation,  and  stiffness.  These  symptoms  are  accompanied  by  autonomic  symptoms, 
sensory abnormalities, and, in the case of Morvan’s syndrome, by brain disorders. Apart from 
neuromyotonia,  Morvan’s  syndrome  manifests  central  symptoms  (insomnia,  hallucinations, 
anxiety, agitation, confusion), autonomic symptoms (hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, obstipation) 
[2].  On  neurophysiological  examination,  neuromyotonia  manifests  prominent  spontaneous 
activity:  fibrillation,  positive  waves,  fasciculations,  myokymia,  multiple  discharges, 
neuromyotonic  discharges,  doublets  and  multiplets.  After  voluntary  contraction,  and  after 
electric stimulation of motor fibers, multiple and long-lasting afterdischarges occur [2]. There 
is  no  clear  consensus  as  to  the  part  of  the  peripheral  motor  neuron  in  which  this  ectopic 
activity  arises.  Most  authors  locate  the  ectopic  focus  in  distal  terminal  motor  fibers.  Both 
antidromic propagation of excitation and axon reflex can participate in triggering this ectopic 
activity.  In  some  conditions  (inflammatory  changes  of  the  central  nervous  system;  CNS) 
ectopic activity sites appear in the area of the anterior horn of the spinal cord as well as in 
higher levels of the CNS [3]. 
Case presentation 
report  describes  a  70-year-old  Caucasian  man  with  presented,  and 
This  case 
electrophysiologically  confirmed,  neuromyotonia  with 
significant  autonomic  and 
psychological  changes  (insomnia,  anxiety,  suicidal  behavior),  and  subsequent  successful 
treatment. 

In  April  2014,  the  70-year-old  man  developed  crural  and  leg  pain,  chills,  tingling, 
hypersensitivity  to  mechanic  stimuli,  and  slight  weakening  of  lower  limbs  with  mild  foot-
drop.  This  disorder  developed  quickly  and  no  trigger  was  identified.  In  June  2014,  he 
developed  insomnia,  anxiety,  confusion,  even  auditory  hallucinations,  and  he  attempted 
suicide by slashing his left wrist. For a short period of time, he was admitted to a psychiatric 
ward. 

He was referred to our neurological clinic electromyography (EMG) laboratory because of 
muscle weakness with prominent fasciculation, myokymia, and suspected amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis.  An  EMG  confirmed  fibrillations,  positive  waves,  fasciculation,  and  multiple 
myokymic and neuromyotonic discharges, occasional high frequency fasciculations, doublets 
and multiplets (Figure 1). Contraction curve was reduced with unstable motor unit potentials 
with neurogenic changes. A motor nerve conduction study showed multiple afterdischarges 
with  long-lasting  repetitions,  which  prevented  F-waves  assessment  (Figure  2).  His  grip 

strength was weakened. He could briefly stand on tiptoes but only with difficulties; walking 
on  heels  was  only  barely  attempted.  He  also  presented  tactile,  thermic  and  vibratory 
hypesthesia of his lower and upper limbs.

His blood test showed high levels of creatine kinase (CK) 12.26 (nkat/L; normal value 3.60), 
CK myocardial bound 0.52, but no other abnormalities. No antibodies (contactin associated 
protein-like 2, CASPR2; leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 protein; contactin 2; anti-glutamic 
acid decarboxylase) were found in his blood or in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Oligoclonal 
protein  synthesis  was  not  confirmed.  Cancer  was  not  detected  (oncological  markers  were 
negative; the results of chest X-ray, ultrasonography of abdomen, endoscopic investigation of 
gastrointestinal tract and urological examination were negative). His CSF showed borderline 
results: protein 0.40g/L and 1 mononuclear cell/1mm3. 

The  findings  were  evaluated  as  neuromyotonia  associated  with  central  cerebral  symptoms 
consistent  with  Morvan’s  syndrome.  No  antibodies  (including  voltage-gated  potassium 
channel, VGKC, and CASPR2) were found either in his blood or CSF. 

For  a  period  of  5  days,  immunoglobulin  was  applied  intravenously  at  a  dosage  of  0.4g/kg 
body  weight.  A  rapid  improvement  in  his  muscle  strength  occurred,  his  fasciculations 
decreased,  and  his  pain  sensation  disorders  were  alleviated,  including  hyperalgesia. 
Subsequently,  venlafaxine  150mg,  carbamazepine  2×200mg,  and  mirtazapine  30mg  each 
night were prescribed. Both his sleep disorder and daytime fatigue were alleviated. A follow-
up  EMG  showed  an  increased  A-sensory  nerve  action  potential  and  shortened  duration  of 
afterdischarges.  His  blood  CK  level  decreased  to  2.31nkat/L.  He  was  discharged  after  14 
days.  A  follow-up  examination  confirmed  stable  state;  he  had  no  sleep  disorder, 
hallucinations or depression. 

The findings were assessed as Morvan’s syndrome of an autoimmune type with undetected 
specific antibodies. 

He has been treated with prednisolone and carbamazepine for more than 8 months and is still 
without  substantial  cramps,  profuse  sweating  and  psychical  problems.  We  expect  from  the 
facts that his outcome will be good [2,4]. 
Discussion 
We described here the case of a 70-year-old man with Morvan’s syndrome; his case is rare 
because  of  his  severe  psychical  changes  (a  suicide  attempt  and  short  admission  to  a 
psychiatric  ward),  prominent  electromyographic  changes,  and  because  antibodies  were  not 
detected. In patients with Morvan’s syndrome without antibodies their therapy should begin 
with  intravenous  immunoglobulins  (IVIGs)  followed  by  corticosteroids  and  with  sodium 
channel blocker. After this recommended therapy the motor, autonomic, psychical signs and 
symptoms, and some of the neurophysiologic changes in our patient substantially improved. 

An  acquired  neuromyotonia  is  frequently  associated  with  autoimmune  disorders,  thymus 
cancer, lymphoma, or lung cancer. Morvan’s syndrome is characterized by neuromyotonia, 
prominent  autonomic  symptoms  (hyperhidrosis,  obstipation,  and  tachycardia)  and  cerebral 
symptoms:  insomnia,  agitation,  anxiety,  confusion,  and  hallucinations.  Patients  with 
Morvan’s  syndrome  display  prominent  leg  pain,  which  sometimes  becomes  a  burning 
sensation, and myalgia [4]. In Morvan’s syndrome, antibodies against VGKCs are confirmed. 
These antibodies cause a reduction in the number of potassium channels, and thus prolong 
nerve  action  potential  on  the  axon  membrane  [3].  Antibodies  against  VGKC  occur  in 
hyperexcitability  of  the  peripheral  nerve,  as  well  as  in  limbic  encephalopathy,  epileptic 
seizures,  and  myoclonus;  that  is  the  reason  why  some  authors  use  the  term  “VGKC 
syndromes”. Antibodies are found in 30 to 50% of patients with neuromyotonia and in the 
majority of patients with Morvan’s syndrome [5]. We failed to detect any antibodies or tumor 
in our patient. Also other authors describe patients with Morvan’s syndrome of autoimmune 
origin  without  detection  of  VGKC.  Our  diagnosis  was  based  on  clinical  findings,  medical 
history, and predominantly on neurophysiological findings. 

Therapy  of  Morvan’s  syndrome  is  focused  on  suppression  of  antibody  production, 
influencing  ion  channels,  and,  subsequently,  neuropathic  pain  control.  In  patients  with 
positive  findings  of  VGKC  antibodies  it  is  recommended  to  commence  the  therapy  with 
plasmapheresis  with  subsequent  oral  immunosuppressive  therapy  applying  corticoids  or 
azathioprine [5]. In patients without VGKC antibodies plasmapheresis is not efficient, and it 
is recommended to start with a full dose of IVIG (2g/kg body weight), and then continue with 
a maintenance dose of corticoids [3]. Carbamazepine at a dose of 400 to 600mg per day leads 
to disappearance of fasciculations and neuropathic pain [2]. 
Conclusions 
Morvan’s syndrome is characterized by motor symptoms (neuromyotonia), neuropathic pain, 
autonomic dysfunction and cerebral symptoms (including insomnia and confusion). Clinical 
presentation  and  neurophysiological  findings  are  essential  for  diagnosis  determination, 
whereas VGKC antibodies are detected only in 50% of cases. In Morvan’s syndrome without 
detected  antibodies,  it  is  efficient  to  apply  IVIG  with  subsequent  oral  therapy  by 
corticosteroids  and  potassium  channel  blockers  to  reduce  autonomic  symptoms  and 
neuropathic  pain.  An  efficient  therapy  significantly  alleviates  a  patient’s  complaints  and 
clinical findings (fasciculation, pseudomyotonia), as well as improvement of typical changes 
detected by neurophysiological examination (myokymia, discharges, afterdischarges). 

We described here a case of a 70-year-old man with severe Morvan’s syndrome; his case is 
rare  because  of  prominent  psychical  changes  (short  hospitalization  in  psychiatric  ward, 
suicide attempt), severe neurophysiological findings, and because he had no antibodies. After 
immunomodulation therapy his clinical and electrophysiological findings partially improved. 
He  was  recommended  to  our  EMG  lab  with  suspicion  of  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis 
because of the prominent fasciculations in his muscles and weight loss.
