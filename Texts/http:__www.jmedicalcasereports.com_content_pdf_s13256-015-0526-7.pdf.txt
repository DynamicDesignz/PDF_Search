Abstract

Introduction: Ileal perforation due to fish bone is a rare event. The condition is difficult to diagnose due to lack of
specific clinical features and low sensitivity of imaging techniques. We report a case of ileal perforation by a fish
bone that was detected laparoscopically and managed nonsurgically.
Case presentation: A 45-year-old Sinhalese man presented with acute onset right iliac fossa pain and fever for
three days. On examination, he had significant right iliac fossa tenderness and guarding. His white cell count and
C-reactive protein level were elevated and an ultrasound scan was indicative of a bowel mass formation. A clinical
diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made and laparoscopic appendicectomy was scheduled. At initial survey, a thin
spike-like structure was retrieved from the bowel mass, which was revealed to be a fish bone. Our patient was
managed with antibiotics only and did not develop any complications.
Conclusions: Ileal perforation due to fish bone is a rare condition that can mimic common conditions like
appendicitis. Preoperative diagnosis is rarely made. The slow process of fish bone migration results in concomitant
sealing of the perforation, reducing contamination. Use of laparoscopy may be useful in diagnosing this condition
and preventing the morbidity of laparotomy in these patients.

Introduction
Perforation of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract due to an
ingested fish bone is a rare event occurring in less than
1 percent of patients [1,2]. Diagnosis of this condition is
difficult as patients rarely recall the ingestion and none
of the imaging techniques can direct toward a definitive
diagnosis [3]. They may present with features of localized
abdominal sepsis and are commonly suspected as having
acute appendicitis. Use of laparoscopy in the management
of acute abdominal conditions, both as a diagnostic
and therapeutic tool, has increased over the recent
past. Although there are few case reports of laparo-
scopic detection of this condition, those patients had
undergone surgery with ileal resection. We report the
case of a patient with ileal perforation due to an

ingested fish bone who was diagnosed by laproscopy
and managed conservatively.

Case presentation
A 45-year-old Sinhalese man presented with a history of
right iliac fossa (RIF) pain and fever for three days. He
did not have nausea or vomiting and was having normal
bowel opening. Our patient had undergone coronary
stenting for ischemic heart disease and was on clopidogrel.
He was not diabetic. On examination, he was afebrile
(37.8ºC) and hemodynamically stable. There was localized
tenderness, guarding and rebound tenderness in the right
iliac fossa. Clinically, there was no free fluid in the peri-
toneal cavity. A clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis
was made. His white cell count was 10,800/mm3 with
75% granulocytes and the C-reactive protein level was
45.7mg/L (normal range: 0 to 5mg/L). An ultrasound
scan of his abdomen revealed a soft tissue mass forma-
tion and localized fluid collection in the RIF suggestive
of an appendicular mass. It was decided to proceed with

a laparoscopic appendicectomy. Pneumoperitoneum was
achieved using the open Hassan technique. A 5mm port
was inserted supraumbilically and a 5mm telescope was
inserted. On initial exploration of the RIF, a mass forma-
tion by ileal
loops with purulent exudative membrane
around the bowel wall and greater omentum was seen
(Figure 1). A thin spike-like structure was protruding from
the ileum in close proximity to the mass. After retrieval, it
was revealed to be a fish bone that had perforated the ter-
minal ileum (Figure 2). The appendix appeared normal.
The mass was not disturbed. It was decided to manage
the condition with intravenous cefuroxime 750mg and
metranidazole 500mg eight hourly as the perforation was
already sealed off. Our patient was free of fever and his
bowel movements returned by the second day and he was
discharged on oral antibiotics. Our patient was found to
be well at a clinic review two weeks after discharge.

Discussion
The majority of
ingested foreign bodies (FBs) pass
through the GI tract uneventfully [4]. Fish bones com-
monly perforate sites with acute angulations such as the
ileocecal junction or the flexures of the colon [5]. They
may rarely perforate the appendix or a Meckel’s diverticu-
lum [3]. Ileal perforation can result in abscess formation

and commonly presents with right iliac fossa pain mimick-
ing acute appendicitis. This patient presented with
features of acute appendicitis with mass formation. The
clinical, biochemical and ultrasonic findings were favoring
the diagnosis of appendicitis. A computed tomography
(CT) scan was not performed as it is not a routine investi-
gation in appendicitis. In a majority of previous cases,
reported CT scans were performed as a supportive investi-
gation although the sensitivity of CT scans in detecting a
fish bone is low [6]. A perforation when detected by CT
scan can appear as a segmental intestinal wall thickening,
localized pneumoperitoneum,
localized fatty infiltration,
or associated intestinal obstruction. However, none of
these findings is specific, and the definitive diagnosis is
made by identification of
the calcified FB [6]. The
visualization of fish bones depends on the degree of calci-
fication and varies with the species of fish [7]. Perera et al.
have reported a case of fish bone migration to the liver
diagnosed with typical ultrasonic features [8]. This
phenomenon occurs when the bone perforates the
hepatic flexure. Most of the previously reported cases
were managed operatively with resection of small
bowel and anastomosis [9,10]. This patient could be
managed expectantly as the perforation was already
partially sealed off by omentum and fibrinous exudate.
An attempt was not made to apply a stitch to the site
as the suture would have cut through inflamed tissue
and the omental cover would have be disturbed in the
process. The peritoneal cavity did not have gross con-
tamination by intestinal content in this patient. This is
a well-recognized feature of perforations caused by fish
bones as the perforation is caused by impaction and
progressive erosion of the FB through the intestinal
wall. This also limits the passage of large amounts of
intraluminal air into the peritoneal cavity making it
difficult to be detected in radiography [5]. The increas-
ing use of laparoscopy for appendicectomy and as a

tool for initial exploration of abdominal sepsis has helped
in diagnosing this type of rare condition, preventing the
morbidity of a laparotomy for patients [11]. This patient
was able to be treated nonsurgically as the cause for his
symptoms and the extent of sepsis could be accurately
ascertained with laparoscopy.

Conclusions
Fish bone perforation of the ileum is a rare condition
that may mimic other common inflammatory conditions.
It is difficult to diagnose clinically or with available im-
aging modalities. The slow process of migration of the
bone through the intestine prevents gross contamination
of the peritoneal cavity. Increasing use of laparoscopy in
managing acute abdominal conditions may help in man-
aging this condition nonsurgically.
