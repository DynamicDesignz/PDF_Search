Abstract 

Introduction 

Kasabach–Merritt  syndrome  is  a  benign  condition  characterized  by  hemangiomatosis, 
severely  disseminated  intravascular  consumption  coagulopathy,  and  thrombocytopenia.  The 
mortality  rate  increases  from  12%  to  30%  in  hemorrhagic  cases.  In  general,  the  symptoms 
primarily manifest in the gastrointestinal tract, the skin, and the subcutaneous tissue. There is 
no publication about pulmonary manifestation of angiomatosis in combination with vascular 
malformation and hemoptysis. This is the first description of a Kasabach–Merritt syndrome-
like condition in the lung. 

Case presentation 

We  present  the  case  of  a  29-year-old  German  woman  with  angiomatosis  and  associated 
pulmonary vascular malformation  in  her lower left lobe with  a Kasabach–Merritt  syndrome 
like  condition.  It  was  detected  after  hemoptysis.  We  also  present  our  case  observations  and 
management. 

Conclusion 

In  a  case  of  angiomatosis  with  an  associated  pulmonary  lobar  vascular  malformation, 
lobectomy can be safely performed to prevent life-threatening bleeding.

Introduction 

Angiomatosis  is  defined  as  a  diffuse  proliferation  of  well-developed  blood  vessels.  It  is  a 
benign condition, continuously affecting a large segment of the body. Formerly classified as 
neoplasm, it is currently defined as vascular malformation. Approximately two-thirds of the 
cases manifest in the first 2 decades of life [1]. Kasabach–Merritt Syndrome (KMS) was first 
described  in  1940  in  a  newborn  male  patient  who  presented  thrombocytopenic  purpura 
associated with rapidly growing capillary hemangioma [2-4]. Since then, the term KMS has 
been used to describe different cases which widely match the initial description [2]. In fact, 
the term  “hemangioma”, used in the  literature for describing a range of vascular anomalies, 
leads  to  difficulties  in  distinguishing  “true  KMS”  from  entities  with  similar  clinical 
presentation  [2].  This,  in  turn,  causes  confusion  concerning  clinical  presentations  and 
outcomes of patients with “true KMS” [3,4]. 

The  etiology  of  the  KMS  remains  unclear.  It  has  been  hypothesized  that  exposure  of  the 
subendothelial  elements  or  abnormal  endothelium  within  the  hemangioma  results  in 
aggregation  and  activation  of  platelets  with  a  secondary  consumption  of  clotting  factors 
[2,3,5,6].  The  primary  treatment  includes  stopping  the  consumption  coagulopathy,  inducing 
regression  of  the  angioma,  and  resecting  the  hemangioma  while  preventing  major  bleeding 
[7,8].  Several  therapy  regimes  have  been  proposed  to  achieve  this  aim.  Here  we  present  a 
case which was classified as KMS and treated with lower left lobectomy. 

Case presentation 

A  29-year-old  German  woman  was  admitted  to  our  hospital  with  a  history  of  hemoptysis  a 
few  days  before  admission.  She  did  not  report  severe  coughing,  emesis,  or  extraordinary 
physical stress. She had been admitted to another hospital 15 years ago because of significant 
gastrointestinal bleeding caused by esophageal varices of 2nd to 3rd degree. A preoperative 
computed  tomography  (CT)  scan  showed  an  upper  abdominal  mass  with  a  potential 
infiltration of her liver. Furthermore, a thrombosis of her portal vein and a partial thrombosis 
of  her  superior  mesenteric  vein  were  detected.  She  displayed  a  splenomegaly  with  a  strong 
lienal vein and a paravertebral vascular plexus. She therefore underwent laparotomy. During 
surgery, the lesion was  diagnosed as a hemangiomatosis of the greater omentum,  extending 
through the hepatoduodenal ligament to the left lobe of her liver; varicose veins of her entire 
stomach wall were also detected. Because of this extension, the lesion was classified as non-
resectable.  A  biopsy  (Figure  1)  of  the  tumor  was  performed,  and  an  end-to-end  portacaval 
anastomosis  was  created.  The  biopsy  was  examined  by  a  consultant  pediatric  pathologist 
(Kiel,  Germany)  and  categorized  as  an  angiomatosis.  Her  postoperative  course  was 
uneventful.  Both  a  KMS  and  an  eventual  hereditary  telangiectasia  (Osler–Weber–Rendu 

syndrome) were considered. Finally, because of the clinical presentation, the disease pattern 
was  classified  as  “KMS”.  Corticosteroid  therapy  was  initiated  for  3  months,  followed  by 
interferon  alpha (IFN  -α) for an additional 3 months.  The patient  survived the following 15 
years without symptoms and then returned with hemoptysis. On admission, she was clinically 
asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable. Her platelet number was 139,000/μL (150,000 to 
450,000/μL) and a gastroscopy revealed grade I esophageal varices without signs of bleeding. 
The  walls  of  her  esophagus,  stomach,  and  upper  small  intestine  were  swollen.  A  chest 
radiograph revealed a shadow on the lower left lobe of her lung. Thereafter, a CT scan of her 
thorax and abdomen was performed. We observed a vasodilation in the lower left lobe of her 
lung and, in particular, a dilation of her intrapulmonary veins (Figure 2). The upper left lobe 
and  her  right  lung  were  not  affected.  After  interdisciplinary  discussion  of  this  case,  we 
decided  to  perform  a  lower  left  lobectomy  to  treat  hemoptysis  and  prevent  life-threatening 
bleeding.  We  performed  an  open  lower  left  lobectomy  through  a  muscle-sparing  antero-
axillary  thoracotomy.  The  motivation  to  choose  an  open  procedure  and  not  a  thoracoscopic 
intervention was to avoid involuntary lung manipulation and allow control of the vulnerable 
dilated vessels (Figure 3). A histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed 
solitary focal  vascular malformations with  associated fresh and old  residual hemorrhages of 
the  neighboring  tissue  (Figure  4).  These  features  may  reflect  “KMS”.  Her  postoperative 
course  was  uneventful.  She  is  still  alive  2  years  after  the  lobectomy  without  any  clinical 
symptoms of KMS.

Discussion 

The  presented  case  reflects  the  condition  of  an  abdominal  angiomatosis  with  associated 
solitary vascular malformation  of the lung  and  KMS-like characteristics. The most frequent 
sites  involved  with  angiomatosis  are  the  lower  extremities;  followed  by  the  chest  wall,  the 
abdomen  and  upper  extremities  [1].  Most  reported  cases  of  KMS  displayed  hemangiomas 
involving the skin, in severe cases visceral sites and the retroperitoneum [2]. In this case, the 
radiological  findings  of  the  chest  CT  scan  showed  a  major  dilatation  of  the  intrapulmonary 
vein originating from the lower left lobe; therefore, we chose resection of the lower left lobe 
to avoid major bleeding in the course of hemoptysis. 

Numerous  therapeutic  approaches  are  available  for  the  treatment  of  KMS.  Various 
nonsurgical  therapies  have  been  reported  for  the  treatment  of  hemangioma,  such  as 
corticosteroids,  IFN-α, vincristine, and radiotherapy  (RT);  however, their  use is  limited due 
to their side effects [9]. One of the proposed regimens is the administration of corticosteroids. 
These  drugs  inhibit  angiogenesis,  which  is  secondary  to  a  variety  of  effects  including 

enhanced  sensitivity  of  the  vascular  bed  and  the  circulation  of  endogenous  vasoconstrictive 
agents  [10].  Other  response  patterns  include  a  partial  decrease  of  the  lesion  size  or  an 
improvement of the bleeding disorder with little effect on the hemangioma. In the treatment 
of  KMS,  glucocorticosteroids  yield  a  heterogeneous  response,  ranging  from  no  effect  to 
regression of the hemangioma, and moderate to complete suppression of coagulopathy [11]. 

Corticosteroids  are  often  used  in  combination  with  RT,  IFN-α,  or  surgery.  IFN-α  inhibits 
angiogenesis  by  suppressing  overexpression  of  the  basic  fibroblast  growth  factor,  an 
angiogenic  protein,  in  infantile  hemangiomas.  Fost  and  Esterly  [12]  treated  24  pediatric 
patients  with  hemangioma  using  IFN-α;  they  documented  a  complete  response  in  42%,  a 
substantial response in 16%, an intermediate response in 26%, and no response in 16% of the 
patients.  However,  many  patients  develop  neurological  deficits  caused  by  IFN-α  treatment, 
especially when initiated at an early age. These symptoms may disappear after the treatment 
is discontinued. 

In the past, RT was the treatment of choice for hemangiomas and KMS. Approximately 85% 
of  the  cases  of  hemangioma  treated  with  RT  prior  to  1960  showed  complete  resolution, 
whereas 15% showed considerable improvement. On occasion, hemangiomas are resistant to 
RT  [5].  Several  late  effects  of  RT  have  been  evaluated  and  reported,  such  as  malignancies 
and growth retardation. These effects are closely related to the total dose and volume of the 
treatment  and  to  the  employed  techniques.  When  RT  is  chosen,  its  lowest  dose  should  be 
used  to  decrease  the  occurrence  of  possible  late  effects  and  secondary  malignancies. 
However, this also causes a decrease in the probability of successful therapy. Consequently, 
none  of  the  nonsurgical  approaches  were  chosen  for  the  presented  case  because  no 
compartment could spatially restrict the bleeding. In a case of a lobar manifestation of KMS, 
lobectomy can be safely performed to prevent life-threatening bleeding. 

Conclusion 

In  a  case  of  angiomatosis  with  an  associated  pulmonary  lobar  vascular  malformation, 
lobectomy can be a promising option to prevent life-threatening bleeding.
