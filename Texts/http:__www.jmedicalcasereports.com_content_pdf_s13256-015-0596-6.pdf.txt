Abstract 
Introduction 

Sinus arrest, atrioventricular block, supraventricular, and ventricular arrhythmias have been 
reported in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. The arrhythmias usually occur during sleep 
and  contribute  to  the  cardiovascular  morbidity  and  mortality;  the  treatment  of  sleep  apnea 
usually  results  in  the  resolution  of  the  bradyarrhythmias.  Weight  loss,  continuous  positive 
airway pressure, oral appliances, and upper airway surgery are the recommended treatments; 
however, compliance and efficacy are issues. 

Case presentation 

A  58-year-old  Arab  man  presented  with  recurrent  presyncope.  He  was  subsequently 
diagnosed  with  sleep  apnea  associated  with  frequent  and  significant  sinus  pauses.  He 
presented a treatment challenge because he refused continuous positive airway pressure and 
pacemaker, however, he was successfully treated with theophylline. 

Conclusion 

Frequent  and  significant  sinus  pause  associated  with  sleep  apnea  was  successfully  treated 
with theophylline in our patient when the standard treatment of care was refused.

Introduction 
Sleep  apnea-associated  bradyarrhythmias  contribute  to  the  cardiovascular  mortality  and 
morbidity of sleep apnea [1-4] and treatment of sleep apnea usually results in resolution of 
bradyarrhythmias [3]. To date, weight loss, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral 
appliances, and upper airway surgery are the recommended treatments; however, compliance 
and  efficacy  are  issues  [5,6].  Our  patient  presented  a  treatment  challenge  because  he  had 
significant sinus pauses associated with sleep apnea, but he refused recommended treatment. 
Theophylline,  used  to  treat  brady-arrhythmia  in  different  settings,  was  introduced  as  an 
alternative treatment option and was successful in treating our patient. 
Case presentation 

A 58-year-old Arab man was referred to our electrophysiology clinic with monthly episodes 
of presyncope for the last 3 months. Despite two episodes of presyncope per year for 3 years, 
he had not sought medical advice. He had multiple comorbidities including coronary artery 
disease  status  post  coronary  artery  bypass  surgery  (CABG),  type  2  diabetes  mellitus, 

dyslipidemia, and class III obesity (body mass index 41) with a neck circumference of 45cm 
and modified Mallampati score of 4. 

After  his  CABG,  aspirin,  atorvastatin,  and  metformin  were  restarted,  with  the  addition  of 
metoprolol  tartrate  25mg  twice  daily.  More  frequent  episodes  of  presyncope  occurred.  An 
electrocardiogram  revealed  normal  sinus  rhythm  with  normal  PR,  QRS  and  QTc  intervals. 
Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal left ventricular systolic function and 
24-hour ambulatory Holter monitoring recorded multiple sinus pauses occurring from 11:22 
p.m. until 11:46 a.m. with a maximum pause of 22 seconds occurring at 11:45:33 a.m. (see 
Figure 1). During this observation, there were no episodes of presyncope.

recording displaying a non-conducted P-wave (small black arrow) preceded by a sinus pause 
of 2.7 seconds (large black arrow) and followed by sinus arrest of 22 seconds with junctional 
escape beats (between the horizontal start and end arrows). The gray arrows point to sinus 
bradycardia and black arrowhead points to the first P-wave, after the return of sinus rhythm.

He was admitted to our hospital for further workup. Despite discontinuation of metoprolol for 
1  week,  his  telemetry  revealed  multiple  episodes  of  sinus  pause,  observed  during  daytime 
sleepiness  or  snoring  episodes.  Obstructive  sleep  apnea  (OSA)  was  suspected  and  a  sleep 
study  demonstrated  both  central  and  OSA:  Epworth  score  7,  sleep  latency  of  17  minutes, 
Apnea–Hypopnea  Index  (AHI)  of  98/hour,  arousal  index  of  49/hour  and  lowest  oxygen 
saturation at 78% on room air (Table 1).

Overnight CPAP was started and the telemetry showed sinus bradycardia with a  minimum 
heart rate of 30 beats per minute with infrequent pauses of less than 3 seconds. However he 
refused to continue to use the CPAP upon discharge. In addition, he was offered a pacemaker 
and he refused. A trial of theophylline 200mg twice daily was initiated and he was discharged 
from our hospital and encouraged to initiate a weight reduction program. 

At follow up, he had no further episode of presyncope with infrequent short or no pauses at 
therapeutic theophylline levels (Table 1). A follow-up sleep study revealed improvement in 
the central element of his sleep apnea, however, his AHI did not significantly improve; such 
results are expected with theophylline therapy (Table 1). 
Discussion 

Sleep  apnea  syndrome  has  been  associated  with  cardiovascular  complications  including 
hypertension  [1],  heart  failure  [2]  and  cardiac  arrhythmia  [3].  Observational  studies  have 
shown  that  treating  sleep  apnea  syndrome  can  decrease  blood  pressure  [1],  reduce  cardiac 
arrhythmia  [3]  and  decrease  cardiovascular  mortality  [4].  Noninvasive  positive  pressure 
ventilation  effectively  decreases  the  incidence  of  sleep  apnea-associated  arrhythmia  [3]; 
however, not all patients can tolerate it and compliance is an issue [5]. We report the case of a 
patient who presented with presyncope most likely secondary to sleep apnea-induced brady-
arrhythmia.  He  was  started  on  beta-blockers  after  his  CABG,  which  could  have  made  his 
brady-arrhythmia worse and contributed to increasing presyncope. However, while he was an 
in-patient  and  off  his  metoprolol  he  continued  to  have  significant  sinus  pause.  He  did  not 
tolerate CPAP and refused a pacemaker so, as a last resort, theophylline treatment was started 
and  he  reported  complete  resolution  of  his  symptoms.  A  Holter  monitor  documented  a 
decrease in both the frequency and duration of sinus pauses. We initiated theophylline based 
on its effectiveness in treating brady-arrhythmia in the setting of post-cardiac transplant [6] 
and spinal cord injury [7]. The mechanism of brady-arrhythmia in sleep apnea syndrome is 
hypothesized to be due to the activation of the diving reflex by hypoxemia and apnea, with 
reflex activation of the cardiac vagal nerve. This induces severe nocturnal bradyarrhythmias, 
especially  during  rapid  eye  movement  sleep  [8].  Theophylline 
is  a  nonselective 
phosphodiesterase  inhibitor  that  also  competitively  blocks  adenosine  receptors  resulting  in 
central  nervous  system  and  cardiovascular  stimulation.  Theophylline  also  increases  the 
respiratory  drive  and  it  has  been  used  in  patients  with  central  sleep  apnea  due  to  left 
ventricular  dysfunction  before  CPAP  and  is  still  recommended  in  patients  who  cannot 
tolerate  CPAP  [9].  For  OSA,  theophylline  has  been  shown  to  mildly  reduce  obstructive 
events but is associated with sleep disruption and therefore it is not recommended [9]. The 
limitations  and  side  effects  of  theophylline  result  from  its  narrow  therapeutic  index, 
traditionally  between  10  and  20mcg/mL  [4]  in  plasma.  Theophylline  is  metabolized  in  the 
liver  through  the  cytochrome  P450  system  and  consequently  is  implicated  in  several  drug 
interactions with commonly prescribed drugs, which may increase serum concentrations of 
theophylline [10]. 
Conclusions 
We report a case of treating sleep apnea-induced brady-arrhythmia with theophylline when 
standard treatment of care was refused. Further studies are needed to determine the safety and 
efficacy  of  theophylline  for  treating  sleep  apnea-induced  bradyarrhythmias  to  ensure  the 
benefits outweigh the risks.
