Abstract

Introduction: We present the case of a patient with acquired hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to parainfluenza
virus infection, a complication that has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously reported.
Case presentation: A 33-year-old Chilean man with fever secondary to parainfluenza 2 virus infection developed
progressive cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia and an increased ferritin level (>2000IU/L). A bone marrow
analysis showed hemophagocytosis. Our patient received HLH-94 chemotherapy, and he achieved complete and
sustained remission after a two-year follow-up, without the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Conclusion: Hemophagocytic syndrome is a severe disease with high mortality. A high index of suspicion is essential
to improve survival. A viral etiology is frequent and although Epstein-Barr virus is the most frequently associated, other
viruses like parainfluenza can cause this disease.
Keywords: Etoposide, Hemophagocytic syndrome, Parainfluenza virus

Introduction
Hemophagocytic syndrome (HS) is a highly lethal dis-
ease characterized by excessive activation of the immune
system with increased levels of cytotoxic lymphocytes
and macrophagic activity [1-4]. Characteristic features
are the deregulation of critical pathways of the immune
response control, an extreme inflammatory state, an in-
crease in cytokine levels, and histiocytic cell hyperactiv-
ity [2]. The disease mainly affects children, with an
incidence of 1:100,000 live births in the US and 1:50,000
live births in Sweden, with a male to female ratio of 1:1.
There are no epidemiological studies in adults; therefore,
the disease incidence is unknown [1]. HS is classified as
primary if associated with genetic congenital alterations;
and secondary if it presents as a consequence of several
acquired diseases, such as hematologic malignancies
(natural killer leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, T
lymphoma and anaplastic large cell
cell peripheral
lymphoma), viral
infections, rheumatoid arthritis, sys-
temic lupus erythematosus and adult onset Still’s disease.
There are cases described in which no specific cause
could be identified [1] (Table 1). The most commonly

associated viral
infection is Epstein-Barr. Other virus
that have been related to HS are cytomegalovirus, parvo-
virus, herpes simplex, varicella zoster, rubella, human
herpes virus 8 and human immunodeficiency virus
[2-13]. Until now there have been no reports of an asso-
ciation between HS and parainfluenza virus.

A diagnosis of HS must be made according to the HLH-
2004 trial diagnostic criteria [1,13,14] (Table 2). The most
important and frequent features are acute onset of fever,
rapidly progressive alteration in liver function tests, hepa-
tosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, cytopenia and elevated
ferritin levels. A finding of hemophagocytosis is helpful,
but not absolutely necessary for diagnosis.

Case presentation
A 33-year-old Chilean man presented to our emergency
room with a fever of one week’s duration associated with
abdominal and back pain. On admission, fever was con-
firmed (39°C) and findings from a physical examination
were normal. Our patient’s daughters had also had a
fever with virus-like upper respiratory symptoms one
week prior to the onset of our patient’s symptoms.

Initial laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive pro-
tein and a normal cell blood count. Blood and urine cul-
tures showed no infection. There was no alteration in
his biochemical serum values. A chest radiography and

abdominopelvic computed tomography showed no anom-
alies. A diagnosis of fever of unknown origin was made
and empirical antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone) was started.
Respiratory and enteric viral polymerase chain reaction
testing was performed, showing parainfluenza virus-2.

Five days after admission, our patient developed painful
bilateral cervical
lymph nodes of 1.5cm, asymmetrical
arthralgias in both hands, and an evanescent self-limited
rash. Laboratory tests showed he had an elevated erythro-
cyte sedimentation rate, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
(Table 3). Clinical worsening was evident without any re-
sponse to empirical antibiotic therapy. Noninfectious
causes of fever were sought, and we ruled out immunologic
diseases and vasculitis. Nine days after admission, we ob-
served an alteration in his liver function test results, which
showed a cholestatic pattern (Table 3) with very high
ferritin levels (1776IU/L) that increased during the following
24 hours (2352IU/L), and with evident hepatosplenomegaly.
Viral hepatitis diagnostic tests were negative. Acquired HS
associated with viral
infection (parainfluenza 2) was sus-
pected. We performed a bone marrow aspiration study:
cytometric analysis showed increased inflammatory cells,
concordant with an acute inflammatory process (Figure 1),

whereas cytology and examination of a biopsy specimen
showed signs of hemophagocytosis (Figure 2). We did not
perform a genetic study of primary forms because it was
very unlikely that our patient had a genetic disease of
delayed presentation.

Because of our patient’s rapid clinical progression with
diagnostic elements compatible with HS, specific therapy
was initiated.

On the 11th day of our patient’s admission, chemother-
apy protocol HLH-94 was initiated with intravenous
etoposide (150mg/m2 twice weekly for two weeks, then
once weekly for six weeks), intravenous dexamethasone
(10mg/m2 daily during weeks one and two, then 5mg/m2
daily during weeks three and four, 2.5mg/m2 daily during
weeks five and six, and finally 1.25mg/m2 daily during
weeks seven and eight), cyclosporine in doses needed to
reach plasmatic levels between 200 and 400μg/dL, and
standard prophylactic anti-fungal and antibiotic therapy.
A couple of days after the initiation of chemotherapy, our
patient showed an acute impairment of consciousness
and respiratory failure without coagulopathy, requiring
mechanical ventilation. Brain magnetic resonance im-
aging showed a 45cm3 left thalamic hematoma, with

insular cortex involvement, mass effect and minimal
midline displacement. After his respiratory failure was
resolved, global aphasia, right-sided hemiparesis, and
swallowing dysfunction were evident. Our patient re-
ceived physiotherapy and speech therapy, resulting in
progressive improvement.

During the second week of chemotherapy, our patient
had neutropenic fever, which was treated with broad
spectrum antibiotics (cefepime plus vancomycin). Tests
revealed a non-fungal
lung infection, with a negative
etiologic study. Complete resolution was achieved before
our patient was discharged.

After initiating the HLH-94 protocol, our patient’s ferritin
levels declined gradually. Our patient’s brother was studied
for the possibility of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT), resulting in human leukocyte
antigen full match compatibility. During hospitalization,

our patient received two weeks of etoposide and dexa-
methasone and was discharged to complete outpatient
chemotherapy. Cyclosporine was gradually decreased
until suspension one year after diagnosis. After two
years of
follow-up, our patient continues to be in
complete remission without the need of a HSCT, with a
good quality of life and ferritin levels in normal ranges.

Discussion
We describe the case of a patient with a common
respiratory infection that progressed into acquired HS.
Because it was highly unlikely that our patient had an
autosomal recessive disorder, which, according to available
evidence, would have presented earlier in life (childhood
or adolescence), and because laboratory tests ruled out
any other cause of macrophage hyperactivation, we believe

had no relationship to his HS, especially considering that
this syndrome manifests in the central nervous system pri-
marily as encephalitis, seizures or lymphocytic meningitis.
However, the association could not be ruled out with
certainty.

Conclusion
HS is a very rare condition that requires a high index of
suspicion, because there is a 90% early mortality without
specific treatment. Hospitalists should have early suspicion
of this lethal disease and achieve an early diagnosis,
especially in patients with acquired disease with possible
autoimmune or viral causes. Management should be in
the hands of a specialist hematological
team, with
advanced life support in severe cases of HS. In our case,
our patient progressed satisfactorily because of a rapid
initiation of chemotherapy, optimal management of vital
support, and appropriate treatment of his complications.
HLH-94 protocol remains the mainstay of
treatment
[14,15] and has remarkably improved overall survival in
acquired HS. In patients with hereditary or congenital
forms of the disease, HSCT must be a priority.

that the presence of this virus had a pathogenic role in
triggering the HS.

Regardless of the cause or trigger, treatment of HS should
be based on urgent commencement of chemotherapy and
HSCT if necessary. The HLH-94 protocol has achieved an
overall survival rate of 55% at 3.1 years in a pediatric popu-
lation [14,15], and is particularly beneficial in the subgroup
of patients without autosomal recessive abnormality of
the genes responsible for the disease (heterozygous or
homozygous) and with a clear association with viral disease,
as in our case. HSCT is mainly performed in patients who
are refractory to treatment and in primary forms of the
disease, especially in children.

Our patient’s response to HLH-94 was good, with
normalization of his ferritin levels and blood cell
counts, significant improvement in his neurological def-
icit, and with no clinical or laboratory evidence of new
macrophage hyperactivation. Intrathecal methotrexate
was not used because our patient did not present with
neurological compromise attributable to macrophage
hyperactivation. Our patient’s intracerebral hemorrhage,
although concomitant with the clinical course, apparently
