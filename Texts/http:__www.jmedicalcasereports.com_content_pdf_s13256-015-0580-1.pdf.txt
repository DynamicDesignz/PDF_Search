Abstract 

Introduction 

Human  infection  with avian  influenza  A (H7N9)  virus  was  first reported on March, 2013  in 
the  Yangtze  River  Delta  region  of  China.  The  majority  of  human  cases  were  detected  in 
mainland  China;  other  regions  out  of  mainland  China  reported  imported  human  cases, 
including  Hong  Kong  SAR,  Taiwan  (the  Republic  of  China)  and  Malaysia,  due  to  human 
transportation. Here, we report the first human case of H7N9 infection imported into Guizhou 
Province during the Spring Festival travel season in January 2014. 

Case presentation 

In  early January 2014, a 38-year-old  healthy Chinese  man, a  migrant worker  returning  from 
previously  H7N9-affected  Zhejiang  Province,  was  identified  as  the  first  human  case  of 
infection  with  avian  influenza  A(H7N9)  virus  in  Guizhou  Province.  He  developed  fever  in 
Zhejiang  at  the  beginning  of  January  2014,  and  returned  to  Guizhou  for  the  Chinese  New 
Year  the  next day.  He  went  to seek  medical care, but deteriorated rapidly  and died on day 8 
after  his  illness  onset.  The  influenza  virus  A/Guizhou/01502/2014  isolated  from  the  patient 
had 99%  identity  with viruses circulating  in  the  Yangtze  River Delta  region. Selected amino 
acids substitutions, well-known to be associated with mammalian adaptation, viral replication 
and drug resistance were similar to other H7N9 viruses circulating in humans.  

Conclusions 

Epidemiology  investigation and  laboratory results confirmed  it was the first  imported case of 
H7N9  infection  in Guizhou Province.  This  finding  further  indicated  that  more  human  H7N 9 
cases  may  be  detected  in  other  regions  due  to  frequent  travel  both  domestically  and 
internationally.

Introduction 

The  first wave of  human  infections with avian  influenza A(H7N9)  virus began  in spring and 
subsided by summer 2013  in China [1], and  it  has re-emerged since October 2013 [2]. As of 
March  10,  2014,  a  total  of  379  cases  and  135  deaths  were  reported  in  mainland  China  [3]. 
However,  human  cases  were  also  detected  in  Hong  Kong  SAR,  Taiwan  (the  Republic  of 
China) [4] and recently the Malaysian  Ministry of  Health announced the  first  imported case 
outside of China on February 12, 2014 [5]. It indicated that human cases could be exported to 
other regions by  frequent travel both domestically and  internationally.  Each  year, billions of 
people  migrate  for  the  Spring  Festival  in  China,  therefore  increasing  the  risk  of  infectious 
diseases  spreading.  Here  we  report  the  first  human  case  of  H7N9  infection  imported  to 
Guizhou Province  from  the epidemic region during  the period of  the so-called  largest annual 
human migration. 

Case presentation 

The  patient  was  a  38- year-old  healthy  Chinese  man,  a  migrant  worker  who  worked  in 
Zhejiang  Province.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  he  developed  influenza-like  illness  (ILI) 
symptoms,  including  headache and 40°C  fever at the beginning of January 2014, and sought 
medical  attention  in  a  village  clinic  and  received  infusion  therapy.  He  went  back  to  his 
hometown  in Guizhou Province  for the coming Spring Festival by taking a  long-distance bus 
from  Zhejiang Province one day after  he developed  fever.  He then sought  medical care  in a 
village clinic and a township hospital when he arrived at his hometown. His chest radiograph 
showed  pneumonia  in  the  lower  lobe  of  his  left  lung  (the  CT  value  ranged  from  −12  to 
approximately −19) and  he was  hospitalized  in a  township  hospital o n day 5 after  his  illness 
onset.  He experienced  high  fever and rapid progression, and was  transferred to a provincial 
general  hospital  in  Zunyi  city.  He  was  diagnosed  as  severe  pneumonia,  deteriorated  rapidly 
and died on day 8 after  his  illness onset. He  had received  symptomatic  treatment during the 
clinical treatment and all  drugs that  had been  used  in  the  township  hospital and  the  general 
hospital  in  Zunyi city are  listed  in  Table 1. No antiviral drugs were administrated during the 
clinical  treatment.  The  case  was  reported  through  the  Chinese  surveillance  system  for 
pneumonia  with  unknown  etiology  and  confirmed  as  human  infection  with  avian  influenza 
A(H7N9)  virus  by  means  of  RT-PCR,  virus  isolation  and  full  genome  sequencing  at  the 
Chinese  National  Influenza  Center  (CNIC).  Since  the  patient  had  died,  written  informed 
consent was obtained from the patient’s next-of-kin for publication of this case report.

Sixty-one close contacts  were  identified by epidemiological  survey,  including 36  health-care 
personnel,  eight  medical  escorts  and  17  household  and  family  contacts.  As  a  public  health 
response,  written  informed  consents  from contacts can be  waived according to Chinese  law. 
The close contacts were  medically  monitored  for seven consecutive days;  no ILI  symptoms 
were  observed  in  all  contacts  except  for  the  patient’s  family  members.  One  family  member 
appeared with a sore throat and developed a 38°C fever  five to seven days after the patient’s 
illness onset, and another developed a sore throat without  fever seven days after the patient’s 
illness  onset.  Continuous  throat  swabs  were  collected  from  them;  all  the  samples  were 
negative  for H7N9  influenza  virus. Antibod y response to  H7N9 virus was  not detected  from 
the paired sera of all contacts. 

The  influenza  virus A/Guizhou/01502/2014 was  isolated  from  the patient. The PB2 gene had 
a  high  degree  of  similarity  (99%)  to  viruses  isolated  from  human  in  Zhejiang  Province. 
Another seven segments showed  the  highest  identity with  viruses  isolated  from birds  in the 
Yangtze  River Delta region, where Zhejiang Province  is  located  (Table 2).  The phylogenetic 
analysis  further  demonstrated  all  eight  gene  segments  were  clustered  with  viruses  that 
circulated  in  this  region  (Figures  2  and  3).  A/Shanghai/1/2013  (SH1,  the  first  H7N9  virus 
isolate),  A/Anhui/1/2013  (AH1,  the  vaccine  strain  recommended  by  the  World  Health 
Organization) and those six  virus  isolates with  highest  identity  with  A/Guizhou/01502/2014 
mentioned  in  Table 2 were selected  for  characteristic comparison of the critical amino acids 
residues  (Table  3).  Similar  to  those  viruses,  the  mammalian-adaptive  mutations  such  as 
G186V and Q226L in the HA gene that were previously reported [6] were found in this virus. 
It  remained  R  in  the  position  292  of  the  NA  gene  and  suggested  the  effectiveness  of 
oseltamivir antiviral treatment. The virus possessed a 627K mutation  in the PB2 gene, which 
was proposed to be associated  with  high polymerase activity and  increased the  virulence  in 
mice [7]. The PB1 L368V  mutation  was  found  in  this  virus,  which  increased  transmission  in 
ferret  [8].  The  signature  amino  acids  of  the  human  influenza  virus  in  the  PA  gene  were 
detected, including V100A, K356R and S409N [9,10]; however, a unique mutation L336M in 
the PA gene that had only been reported in a Hong Kong isolate [11] was not detected.

Conclusions 

This is the first imported human H7N9 case of a migrant worker moving from epidemic areas 
to  unaffected  regions  during  the  Spring  Festival  migration,  which  is  a  period  of  travel  in 
China with an extremely high traffic load around the time of the Chinese New Year. 

Unlike  most  previously  reported  fatal  cases  of  patients  who  were  older  and/or  who  had 
underlying  medical  conditions  [12],  this  patient  was  young  and  reported  without  any 
underlying  medical  conditions.  No  mutations  associated  with  antiviral  resistance  were 
detected; one possibility for the rapid deterioration and death of the patient may be due to the 
fact  antiviral  drugs  were  not  used  during  his  treatment.  The  virus  isolated  from  the  patient 
showed  a  high  identity  with  viruses  circulating  in  the  Yangtze  River  Delta  region  and  he 
developed  respiratory  syndromes  before  his  arrival  in  Guizhou  Province.  He  visited  a 
neighborhood  live  poultry  market  before  his  illness  onset,  which  indicated  the  potential 
infection  source  was  likely  to  be  the  infected  poultry  in  the  market,  as  previously  reported 
elsewhere [12-14]. Further, the  H7N9 virus was  not detected  in Guizhou based on the results 
of  poultry-related  environmental  surveillance  since  2009  (data  not  shown).  These  data 
concluded  that  the  case  had  been  introduced  from  an  affected  region  by  the  movement  of 
people.  Imported  human  cases  of  the  H7N9  virus  travelling  from  affected  areas  to  non-
endemic  areas  domestically  and  internationally  have  been  reported  in  Hong  Kong  SAR, 
Taiwan  (the  Republic  of  China)  and  Malaysia  during  the  first  and  second  wave  of  H7N9 
infections  [4,5,15].  In  each  year,  millions  of  migrant  workers  from  rural  areas  of  Guizhou 
Province  go to  work  in  the  Yangtze  River  Delta and the Pearl River Delta and return  home 
for  a  reunion  with  their  family.  With  the  increasingly  frequent  movement  of  people,  it  is 
foreseen that more human H7N9 cases may be detected in other regions due to frequent travel 
both domestically  and  internationally. Considering  the rapidly progressive pneumonia,  acute 
respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS),  the  high  rates  of  ICU  admission  and  death,  early 
detection  and  antiviral  drug  therapy  of  suspected  cases  imported  from  affected  areas  are 
essential to reduce the case fatality rate of H7N9 virus infection.  

The  undetected  H7N9 virus of  the respiratory specimens and the  negative antibody  response 
to  H7N9  in  his  family  members  who  presented  clinical  syndromes  indicated  that  the 
transmission from the patient to his family members could be ruled out.
