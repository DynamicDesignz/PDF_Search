The importance of good history taking: a case
report
Durga Ghosh1* and Premalatha Karunaratne2

Abstract

Introduction: Early comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with good history-taking is essential in assessing the
older adult.
Case presentation: Our patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian woman, was originally admitted to hospital for investigation
of iron deficiency anemia. During admission, she developed pneumonia and new intermittent atrial fibrillation in
association with a right-sided weakness, which was felt to be new at the time.
Following this episode, she was treated for a further chest infection and, despite clinical improvement, her
inflammatory markers failed to settle satisfactorily.
She was transferred to her local hospital for a period of rehabilitation where further neurological findings made
the diagnosis of solely stroke questionable; these findings prompted further history-taking, investigations and
input from other disciplines, thereby helping to arrive at a working diagnosis of vasculitic neuropathy.
Conclusions: The case aims to highlight the importance of taking a good history and performing an early
comprehensive assessment in the older adult.

Introduction
Good history-taking, an essential part of a comprehen-
sive assessment in an older adult [1], helped reveal an
underlying debilitating neuropathy.

Case presentation
Our patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian woman, was admit-
ted to hospital for investigation of iron deficiency anemia
in June 2013. Her hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit and mean
cell volume (MCV) levels preadmission were 10.1g/dL,
0.33 and 77 fL, respectively.

There was little known about her past medical history
aside from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) requiring
insulin, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). Investigation for iron deficiency anemia
confirmed extensive diverticular disease with normal upper
gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and duodenal biopsy.

During the same admission, she developed a hospital-
atrial

and new intermittent

acquired pneumonia
fibrillation.

Coinciding with this period, she developed a new dys-
phasia and what was perceived to be a ‘new’ right-sided
weakness. A computed tomography (CT) brain scan
showed no acute change and she was treated as a patient
with ischemic stroke, given the clinical findings.

She was treated for a further pneumonia in hospital
and also underwent investigations such as a CT pulmon-
ary angiography (CTPA) scan, which ruled out pulmonary
embolism but confirmed partial left lung collapse; subse-
quent bronchoscopy was negative for malignancy. Her
inflammatory markers remained elevated with her C-
reactive protein (CRP)
level approximately 140 and
white cell count (WCC) 14 but she remained mentally
alert and made clinical improvement. Her repeat chest
X-rays were also unchanged. Given the clinical
im-
provement, she was deemed suitable for transfer for
stroke rehabilitation to her local hospital
in August
2013. Her medications on transfer were: Novomix 30
twice daily (later stopped due to low blood sugar levels);

clopidogrel 75 mg; quinine sulphate 200 mg; ranitidine
150 mg twice daily; folic acid 5mg; and digoxin 125mcg.
In the Rehabilitation and Assessment Directorate
(RAD), the assumption was that our patient had suffered
a stroke causing a right-sided weakness, as per the hand-
over pre-transfer, however, further neurological features
were detected on the post-take ward round as listed
below: right lower motor neurone seventh nerve weak-
ness; ptosis right greater than left; bilateral wrist drop;
bilateral
foot drop; generalized reduced tone and re-
duced power in all four limbs: right arm 3 out of 5, right
leg 0 out of 5, left arm 3 to 4 out of 5, and left leg 2 out
of 5. No comment was documented regarding sensation.
The chronicity of the neurological features was uncer-
tain at this point as they did not appear to have been
previously documented and the immediate reaction was
to exclude an acute neurological process. Fortunately,
her daughter was present during the ward round that
day and a collateral history revealed our patient had
‘possibly’ been like this for 18 months or more. This led
to a degree of reassurance with regard to the fact that
the neurological findings were unlikely to be acute.

Further discussion with our patient’s son confirmed
that her mobility had gradually deteriorated over a two-
year period; from his perception, the only novel finding
was alteration of our patient’s speech at the time of a
presumed ischemic stroke.

Given the account from our patient’s son and daugh-
ter, her general practitioner (GP) was also contacted and
it was reported that our patient had been referred to
various disciplines for poor mobility but had failed to
attend her appointments; she had been diagnosed with a
Bell’s palsy and third nerve palsy in 2011, which had
been attributed to her diabetes. Interestingly, a previous
trial of steroids from her GP for presumed arthropathy
had resulted in clinical improvement.

Our patient underwent several investigations, included
below, as part of the investigative and diagnostic process.
In addition, for the complete history, her blood pressure
was 104/53 mmHg and heart rate was 57 beats/minute
with no documented murmurs.

Imaging
A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan showed
atrophy with small vessel disease, high signal at the left
corona radiata and adjacent left occipital horn. An MRI
cervical spine scan revealed no gross abnormality and a
CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed extensive
diverticular disease only.

Blood investigations
Blood tests showed her Hb level was 85g/dL; WCC was
11.1; platelets were 512, MCV was 89 and her hema-
tinics were normal. Urea and electrolytes test (U&E),

liver function test (LFT), and calcium test results were
normal. Her albumin level was l0, CRP level was 120
and her baseline HBA1c level was 57mmol/L (normal
range 20 to 42mmol/L). Her cholesterol level was unavail-
able and her blood and urine cultures were negative.

Vasculitic screen
Her antinuclear antibody test (ANA) results were 1/40
and showed a speckled pattern. She had low C3 0.71g/L
(0.88 to 1.82g/L) and low C4 0.08g/L (0.16 to 0.45g/L).
Her rheumatoid factor was 623, antineutrophil cytoplas-
mic antibody (cANCA) results were strongly positive
and myeloperoxidase/proteinase 3 (MPO/PR3) negative.
Her immunoglobulin A (IgA) level was 6.5, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) 115, and cryoglobulins were
negative. Her carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and serum
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were normal,
and CA 125 test result was 70 (0 to 35). Serum electro-
phoresis showed no paraproteins and her neuroimmuno-
logical blood test results were negative.

Invasive investigations
Her lumbar puncture test result was negative.

Neurology unit investigations
Electromyography (EMG) showed severe axonal sensory
motor neuropathy.

Multi-specialist input from several disciplines includ-

ing rheumatology and neurology was also requested.

The neurologist documented the following clinical
findings: right ptosis; right facial weakness; generalized
weakness right greater than left; profound distal greater
than proximal weakness and wasting left greater than
right; upper limb greater than lower limb; sensation
distally decreased in lower limbs; and areflexia.

The general consensus was that our patient was prob-
ably manifesting a peripheral neuropathy secondary to a
vasculitis (the type of which was difficult to classify); the
neuropathy had been possibly exacerbated by a recent
stroke; the stroke may have been part of the vasculitic
process itself or could have been related to atrial
fibrillation.

It was felt that a nerve biopsy would have little else to
contribute to the diagnosis and simultaneously might
induce patient distress and was therefore avoided.

Given her history of T2DM, our patient was cautiously
commenced on a trial of prednisolone 40mg with azathi-
oprine on 13 September 2013; additional oral antidiabetic
therapy on advice of the diabetic team was commenced
and gradual step-down of steroid therapy was planned.

Within days of steroid initiation, our patient’s inflam-
matory markers improved. Her CRP level fell to 36 and
her WCC to single figures.

Her right wrist drop showed slight improvement from
initial
investigations to the point of discharge. There
was, however, little neurological and functional improve-
ment otherwise.

Our patient remained bedbound and her hospital stay
was complicated by a pressure ulcer, which had com-
pletely healed prior to discharge to a care home six
months later. On discharge her blood test results
revealed Hb of 94, WCC of 11.5, her platelets were 380
and MCV 90.8, her CRP level was 20 and albumin level
was 28. She remained clinically stable and her treatment
goal was to help prevent any further neurological
deterioration.

Discussion
Our patient had been admitted for investigation of iron
deficiency anemia and suffered recurrent illness during
admission precipitating a prolonged hospital admission
and eventual transfer to her local hospital for stroke
rehabilitation.

Looking back at the case, our patient did have a stroke
as was confirmed on MRI; however, the fact that she had
bilateral and long-standing neurological signs evaded
detection for a considerable period of time.

It is only after a thorough history-taking, examination
and comprehensive geriatric assessment post transfer to
the rehabilitation unit that her illness was diagnosed.
Though there may not have been a great change to her
overall quality of life, an underlying debilitating diagno-
sis was established with a treatment goal attempting to
prevent further neurological deterioration.

It can be argued that had a comprehensive geriatric as-
sessment taken place earlier, keeping in mind that she
had displayed neurological symptoms some 18 months
previously, would earlier initiation of treatment been
more effective in improving her quality of life? Should
the fact that she had failed to attend appointments
prompted further thinking as to the underlying factor
causing nonattendance at clinic appointments, keeping
in mind that there was a history of neurological signs?

Conclusions
The case aims to highlight the importance of taking a
good history and performing a comprehensive assess-
ment, especially in the older adult [1].
