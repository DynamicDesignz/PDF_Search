Bilateral uveitis and Usher syndrome: a case
report
Matthew D Benson and Ian M MacDonald*

Open Access

Abstract

Introduction: Usher syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition and represents the most common cause
of inherited combined vision and hearing loss. Deficits manifest as sensorineural hearing loss that typically develops
at a young age and retinitis pigmentosa that can lead to peripheral vision loss and night blindness. As a result, this
syndrome can have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life.
Previous studies have described an association between Usher syndrome and Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis, a form of
non-granulomatous uveitis that generally presents in a unilateral manner. We present a rare finding of bilateral uveitis
and, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of granulomatous uveitis as a feature in a patient with Usher syndrome.
Case presentation: A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with a known history of retinitis pigmentosa presented to our clinic
with suspected Usher syndrome, given her report of long-standing hearing loss. Aside from a mild loss in visual acuity,
our patient was otherwise asymptomatic. Visual field testing, audiology and electroretinography findings supported the
diagnosis of Usher syndrome. With slit lamp examination she was found to have bilateral keratic precipitates, with large,
greasy-white, mutton-fat keratic precipitates on the endothelial surface of her left eye. A thorough work-up that included
blood tests and imaging was negative for an alternative cause of her uveitis.
Conclusion: We present a rare finding of bilateral uveitis and what we believe to be the first reported instance of
mutton-fat keratic precipitates and granulomatous uveitis as a feature in a patient with Usher syndrome. By identifying
atypical presentations of the disease, we hope to contribute to the range of ophthalmic conditions that may be seen in
association with Usher syndrome.

Introduction
Usher syndrome represents a genetically diverse condi-
tion that involves both early-onset sensorineural hearing
loss and retinal pathology. While reports of disease
prevalence vary, the condition has been estimated to
occur in three in 100, 000 individuals. Moreover, Usher
syndrome is the most common cause of combined deaf-
ness and blindness, accounting for nearly 50% of all
cases [1-3].

There exist three distinct types of Usher syndrome
that differ based on the onset and severity of symptoms.
Type 1 includes individuals with profound deafness at
birth with the onset of visual disturbances occurring
prior to puberty. This is the most severe form of disease
and is often accompanied by vestibular dysfunction.

Type 2 involves congenital hearing loss that is less se-
vere than type 1, with the onset of retinal disease occur-
ring in the first or second decade of life. Finally, Type 3
is the least common presentation and involves variable
onset of both hearing and vision difficulties [2].

Currently, there are a number of genes with causative
roles in Usher syndrome. These genes are inherited in
an autosomal recessive manner and encode for peptides
that form a complex in sensory hair cilia of the inner ear
and in photoreceptors of the retina. Mutations in these
genes lead to sensorineural hearing loss that is generally
non-progressive and retinal changes consistent with ret-
initis pigmentosa (RP) [1].

Uveitis is a form of ocular inflammation that can in-
volve the iris, ciliary body and choroid, and is subdivided
into granulomatous and non-granulomatous types. These
types may be differentiated based on the inflammatory cells
present: granulomatous uveitis involves macrophages and

epithelioid cells and non-granulomatous uveitis is predom-
inantly defined by a lymphocyte and plasma cell response
[4]. To date, several studies have demonstrated an associ-
ation of RP with a form of non-granulomatous uveitis
called Fuchs’ heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHIC) [5-9]. This
form of anterior uveitis is characterized by stellate
endothelial keratic precipitates
(KPs) and atrophic
changes in the iris. More recently, two studies have con-
firmed an association between Usher syndrome and
FHIC [10,11]. Furthermore, a recent study reported a
case of non-granulomatous uveitis that was distinct
from FHIC in a patient with Usher syndrome [3].

While associations between Usher

syndrome and
FHIC have been described and observed in patients, the
uveitis typically presents in a unilateral manner. To the
best of our knowledge, a case of granulomatous uveitis
in a patient with Usher syndrome has not previously
been reported. We present a rare finding of bilateral
uveitis and what we believe to be the first case of a pa-
tient with granulomatous anterior uveitis of unknown
etiology in the setting of Usher syndrome.

Case presentation
A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with RP, previously di-
agnosed in 2005, presented to our clinic following a re-
ferral for suspected Usher syndrome given her history of
concomitant high frequency hearing loss. Apart from a
mild loss in visual acuity that had been relatively stable
for several years, our patient did not have any other sig-
nificant ocular symptoms,
including, most notably, an
absence of pain, redness and photophobia. Her medical
history was significant for hypertension, for which she
was taking a diuretic medication. She was also taking
vitamin A supplements. She was not taking any ocular
medications and she denied a history of ocular trauma
or pathology aside from RP.

Her family history included a 49-year-old sister who
was blind with RP and had hearing loss since childhood.
Another sister, 47 years old, had a slowly progressive
form of tunnel vision with RP (her hearing status was
presumed normal). Her two other siblings, a brother and
a sister, did not have any vision or hearing impairments.
On examination, our patient had a visual acuity of 20/
30+2 in her right eye and 20/30 in her left eye. There
was no improvement with pinhole correction. Her intra-
ocular pressures were within normal limits in both eyes.
With slit lamp examination, her external examination
was normal and her sclera and conjunctiva were not
injected. Several small, round KPs were observed on the
inferior corneal endothelium in her right eye; however,
the anterior chamber was quiet and deep. In the inferior
aspect of her left corneal endothelium there were nu-
merous large, greasy-white mutton-fat KPs (Figure 1A).
There were 2+ cells based on Standardization of Uveitis

syndrome. (A) Anterior segment image with numerous large,

Nomenclature classification [12] but no flare in the an-
terior chamber of her left eye. Her irides were round
and flat with no evidence of posterior synechiae or het-
erochromia. Both eyes had posterior subcapsular cataracts
(Figure 1B) and there were occasional pigmented anterior
vitreous cells in her left eye. A retinal examination re-
vealed pale optic nerves with arteriolar attenuation and
mid-peripheral bone spicule pigment distribution. There
were no signs of pars planitis or retinitis with scleral de-
pression. In addition to her known RP, bilateral uveitis
with granulomatous uveitis in her left eye was diagnosed
based on examination findings.

A macular optical coherence tomography scan demon-
strated a preserved macula with no cystoid macular
edema. Her previous records indicated an extinguished
response with vestigial
flicker on electroretinography,
suggestive of advanced RP, and moderate bilateral sen-
sorineural hearing loss with severe loss at higher fre-
quencies from an audiology assessment. Our patient had
no obvious speech impediments and she did not have
cochlear implants. Prior visual field testing had revealed
bilateral ring scotomas with central sparing.

A thorough uveitis work-up demonstrated that her
angiotensin-converting enzyme, calcium, and liver enzyme
levels were within normal limits. She had a slightly ele-
vated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 25 mm/h (normal
range: 0 to 20 mm/h). Tests for human leukocyte antigen
B27 and syphilis were negative. A chest X-ray showed no
definite hilar or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy and no
signs of tuberculosis. Findings from an X-ray of her sacro-
iliac joints were normal.

Based on these results, our patient was diagnosed with
type 2 Usher syndrome with an associated granuloma-
tous uveitis of undetermined etiology. Given the absence
of symptoms and apparent chronicity of presentation,
treatment was not indicated at the time of her presenta-
tion. She was encouraged to attend follow-up appoint-
ments to monitor the progression of her disease and any
possible complications of the uveitis. Formal genetic
testing was discussed, but access to clinical testing is
generally problematic and research testing has yet to be
initiated.

Discussion
Usher syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition
that represents the most common cause of inherited
deafness and blindness. Individuals typically present with
marked sensorineural hearing loss and vision impair-
ment secondary to retinitis pigmentosa. The differenti-
ation of the forms of Usher syndrome based solely on
symptoms may be problematic and not lead to a specific
diagnosis.
is
called upon, when available on a clinical basis, to guide
the investigation of these cases. To date, fourteen gene
loci have been implicated in Usher syndrome with ten of
these genes being identified [13]. Inherited in an auto-
somal recessive pattern, mutations in these genes can
lead to functional impairment with significant quality of
life implications, making this an important condition to
recognize and accurately diagnose.

Increasingly molecular genetic analysis

Several studies have demonstrated an association be-
tween RP, the main ocular phenotype in Usher syn-
drome, and FHIC [5-9]. The presentation of anterior
uveitis in FHIC is typically unilateral and chronic, with
patients often lacking any symptoms. A characteristic
slit-lamp finding involves stellate KPs on the corneal
endothelium, providing further evidence for this non-
granulomatous form of uveitis. While the majority of
studies that observed FHIC in patients with RP de-
scribed unilateral KPs as expected, Sandinha et al. re-
ported a case of bilateral stellate KPs [8].

More recently, studies have demonstrated an association
between Usher syndrome and FHIC [10,11]. Lichtinger
et al. performed a retrospective analysis of 58 patients
with RP and discovered an even stronger association be-
tween FHIC and Usher syndrome. In the two cases

presented in that study, both patients had unilateral stel-
late KPs [10]. In addition, another study demonstrating
this association also presented the case of a patient with
unilateral stellate KPs [11].

We report the case of a patient with Usher syndrome
and bilateral KPs, a rare finding in the literature. More-
over, our patient presented with numerous large, greasy-
white mutton-fat KPs on the endothelial surface of her
left eye. To the best of our knowledge, this finding has
not been previously reported in a patient with Usher
syndrome. To date, all but one case of uveitis in Usher
syndrome has been attributed to FHIC: Alzuhairy and
Alfawaz described a case of non-granulomatous uveitis
in a patient with Usher syndrome that did not resemble
FHIC [3]. We have, however, been unable to find an ob-
servation in the literature of granulomatous uveitis in
Usher syndrome. We thus present this rare finding in a
recognizable syndrome. It should be mentioned that be-
cause this is the first reported instance the possibility of
a coincidental association cannot be ruled out.

While the mechanism explaining the association of
uveitis and Usher syndrome has not been established,
there have been suggestions that an underlying auto-
immune reaction may be responsible. Retinal S antigen
is present in rod photoreceptors and has been implicated
in inflammatory eye conditions including uveitis and ret-
inal disease [14]. Patients with RP have been shown to
have B cells that respond and react to retinal S-antigen
[15]. It has been suggested that patients with RP, and
thus patients with Usher syndrome, may have an under-
lying tendency for immune reactions that predispose
them to developing uveitis. Furthermore, Chowers et al.
suggest that patients with RP may develop reactions to
antigens in the anterior chamber of the eye that can re-
sult in uveitis [5]. In their study, they referenced FHIC
and suspected other factors involved in the development
of uveitis in RP because FHIC typically presents unilat-
erally. We discovered bilateral KPs in our patient, which
adds support to a proposed underlying immune mech-
anism because uveitis would not be expected to prefer-
entially affect one eye. The granulomatous reaction seen
in our patient does, however, suggest that other factors
may exist and contribute to uveitis in Usher syndrome.

Conclusion
We have reviewed Usher syndrome: a heterogeneous
condition that represents the most common inherited
cause of combined vision and hearing loss. Deficits typ-
ically manifest early on in a patient’s life and the condi-
tion can have a significant impact on quality of life. As a
result, early detection with an accurate diagnosis is espe-
cially important.

While an association between Usher syndrome and
non-granulomatous uveitis has been described, our finding

of bilateral uveitis is a rare occurrence. Furthermore, to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report granu-
lomatous uveitis as a finding in Usher syndrome. Our pa-
tient demonstrated numerous mutton-fat KPs on her
corneal endothelium that could not be attributed to any
known cause. We hope that this illustration of a rather
atypical finding in a patient with Usher syndrome may add
to the clinical spectrum of ophthalmic conditions that can
be seen in association with Usher syndrome.
