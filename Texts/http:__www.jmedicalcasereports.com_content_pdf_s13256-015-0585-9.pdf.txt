Cutaneous metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma
of the urinary bladder eight years after the
primary: a case report

Andrea Nicole Lees

Abstract

Introduction: Cutaneous metastasis of bladder carcinoma is extremely rare with a limited number of published
cases. An awareness of this rare clinical entity and high index of suspicion is needed for diagnosis, as it can occur
months or rarely as in this case, even years, after the primary cancer.
Case presentation: An 81-year-old Caucasian man presented with a one-year history of increasing left leg swelling
and a two-month history of a macular-nodular rash on the anterior thigh, on a background of a high-grade (WHO
Grade 2 of 3) papillary and invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in 2006. Following investigations, he
was diagnosed as having probable locoregional recurrence of previously resected urothelial cancer of the bladder
with extensive retrograde lymphatic permeation into the left thigh with cutaneous eruptions of malignancy. He
completed a planned course of palliative radiation therapy to the left thigh lesions (30Gy divided over 10 fractions)
as well as the left pelvic node (a total dose of 18Gy divided over six fractions). The disease ran an aggressive course
and our patient died six months after the diagnosis of cutaneous metastases.
Conclusions: Metastatic disease should always be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with a
previous history of bladder cancer who present with cutaneous nodules, even many years after the initial
diagnosis at the primary site.

Introduction
In 2009, there were 2,316 new cases of bladder cancer in
Australia, accounting for 2% of all new cancers [1].
Bladder cancer is four times more common in men than
women [1]. However, in 2010, relative survival rates for
bladder cancer were higher for men than for women in
Australia [2]: the five-year relative survival for bladder
cancer for the period 2006 to 2010 was 60.0% for men
and 49.6% for women [2]. Approximately 50% of the
patients will develop local recurrence and/or metastatic
disease after radical cystectomy [3]. Cutaneous metasta-
sis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is rare. The inci-
dence is reported to be less than 1%, and ranges from
0.18% to 2% for TCC of the urinary bladder [4]. Of the
cutaneous metastasis from genitourinary organs, TCC of
the bladder accounts for 17% of cases [5]. It may occur

at the time of diagnosis, or appear months or even years
after the primary lesions are found [6]. Rarely, it may
present as the first symptom of the disease [7]. We
present the case of a patient with a rare cutaneous
metastasis of TCC in the absence of generalized recur-
rent disease.

Case presentation
An 81-year-old Caucasian man presented with a one-
year history of increasing left leg swelling, initially in the
calf and subsequently extending to the thigh. The
general practitioner requested a venous Doppler ultra-
sound of the left leg and a computed tomography (CT)
scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which failed to discover
any underlying cause. He had developed multiple lesions
on the left anterior thigh, which increased significantly
in number and size over two months.

Eight years before this presentation, in 2006, he under-
went a cystectomy and ileostomy for high-grade TCC of

the bladder. The cystoprostatectomy specimen showed
invasive TCC extending into the inner half of his muscu-
laris propria (Stage pT2a) but with a single focus of
advential intralymphatic tumor, arising in a background
of high-grade transitional cell carcinoma in situ mainly
involving the left bladder wall. Ureteric and urethral
margins were clear and there was no significant prostatic
pathology. Histopathology of the resected trigone and
lateral bladder wall was graded 2 of 3 in the WHO
classification. An abdominal and pelvic CT scan demon-
strated no para-aortic or pelvic lymphadenopathy, and
no distant metastasis. It was hoped that the cystoprosta-
tectomy was curative and, therefore, he did not require
adjuvant treatments.

On physical examination in 2014,

there was left
lower limb edema extending to his thigh and a well-
demarcated macular-nodular
rash on his anterior
thigh (Figure 1A). There were no palpable masses or
nodes in his groin or popliteal fossa bilaterally. His
abdomen was soft and non-tender.

Laboratory parameters demonstrated a normocytic
anemia with a hemoglobin level of 103g/L (reference
range, 130 to 175), stable since at
least 2011; and
normal platelet and white cell counts. Iron studies were
consistent with anemia of chronic disease, with a nor-
mal ferritin level of 78ug/L (reference range, 30 to 310),
reduced iron level of 3umol/L (reference range, 11 to
28) and saturation of 6% (reference range 15 to 50),
and transferrin level at the lower limit of normal at
2.1g/L (reference range, 2.0 to 3.6). His B12 and folate
levels were normal and thyroid-stimulating hormone
level was reduced at 0.19mU/L (reference range, 0.5 to
5.5) (there were no T3 or T4 levels on record). His
coagulation profile was normal. His electrolytes were
normal, however, his creatinine level was elevated at
117umol/L, and his estimated glomerular filtration rate
was reduced but stable (since at least 2012) at 50mL/
min/1.73m2. Liver function and adjusted calcium tests
were normal. There was no C-reactive protein, erythro-
cyte sedimentation rate, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
or other tumor markers on record. Cytology was nor-
mal on urinalysis. A skin punch biopsy demonstrated
features favoring metastatic, poorly differentiated non-
small cell carcinoma (Figure 2). Immunohistochemical
staining (Figure 3)
showed strong diffuse positive
staining for cytokeratin (CK) 7 and cytokeratin 20 and
focal positive staining for cytokeratin CK5/6 and P63.
The tumor cells were negative for PSA and thyroid
transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). The above cytokeratin
immunoprofile is consistent with metastatic TCC
showing focal squamoid differentiation. Left lower limb
lymphoscintigraphy confirmed severe lymphedema in
his left leg. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of his chest,
abdomen, pelvis and thighs did not demonstrate any

mass or adenopathy in the pelvis or left groin to
explain our patient’s left leg lymphedema. There was
no other evidence of metastatic disease. A magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine demon-
strated no evidence of metastatic disease to his spine,
however, a whole body bone scan found multiple osteo-
blastic metastases throughout the bony pelvis. Positron

with the known cutaneous metastases. Sclerotic bone
lesions with increased uptake on the bone scan were
not highly fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid in compari-
son to the avid pelvic node and thought to be possibly
related to an alternative pathology such as prostate
cancer.

He completed a planned course of palliative radiation
therapy to the left thigh lesions (30Gy divided over 10
fractions) as well as the left pelvic node (a total dose
18Gy divided over six fractions). Methotrexate was ex-
cluded as a treatment option in our patient in light of
the potential for accumulation in the ‘third space’ com-
prising the lymphedema in his left leg. Our patient
became too unwell to undergo a subsequent planned
course of chemotherapy (carboplatin and gemcitabine).
The disease ran an aggressive course and our patient
died six months after the diagnosis of cutaneous
metastases.

Discussion
Since the first recorded case of cutaneous metastases of
TCC of the urinary bladder in 1909 [8],
infrequent
reports have reached the world literature. Skin metasta-
ses may occur at any time after the initial diagnosis at
the primary site [9]. From the published literature, cuta-
neous metastases most often occur within 18 months of
the primary diagnosis, and only one documented case
occurring 10 years after the primary diagnosis [10]. The
incidence of metastatic TCC of the bladder is directly
related to depth of penetration of the bladder wall,
tumor grade and tumor size, with depth of tumor pene-
tration being the single most
in
predicting prognosis in TCC [11,12]. However, metasta-
ses may be associated with superficially invasive primary
disease [13,14]. Urologic malignancies most commonly
lung and
metastasize to regional
bones [5,15]. Metastatic infiltration of
the skin or
subcutaneous tissues can occur due to direct tumor
invasion, hematogenous or lymphatic spread, or as a re-
sult of iatrogenic implantation of tumor cells [5]. Gross
appearance of cutaneous metastases is not distinctive
and may mimic many common dermatologic disorders
[16,17]. These lesions can be solitary or multiple in
appearance [14,15,18]. Brownstein et al. described three
clinical features of metastatic cutaneous lesions, includ-
ing a nodular type, inflammatory type, and sclerodermoid
type [19]. In addition, a rarer zosteriform lesion has also
been documented [20-22]. Metastatic skin lesions from
genitourinary TCC are reported to be always located on
the head, face, neck, trunk, abdomen, suprapubic region
or extremities, as well as occasionally on scrotal skin and
the ocular region [9].

emission tomography (PET) demonstrated diffuse left

were multiple small foci of nodular uptake seen on the
anteromedial aspect of the left distal thigh consistent

established by microscopic examination of excisional
biopsy specimens [9]. Among reported cases, cutaneous
metastases of TCC almost exclusively show high-grade
differentiation of histological grading at the primary
genitourinary sites [9]. Wang et al. discovered that co-
ordinated expression of cytokeratins 7 and 20 are posi-
tive in 89% of transitional cell bladder cancer [23].

The prognosis for patients with cutaneous TCC is
typically poor, with a median survival of fewer than 12
months [17]. However, very rare cases of extended sur-
vival (up to 23 years) have been reported [24]. The
treatment of choice for metastatic bladder cancer is
either chemotherapy, with the combination of gemcita-
bine and cisplatin or the methotrexate, vinblastine,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) scheme; or pallia-
tive care [25]. Chemotherapy has
reported tumor
remission rates up to 70% [25], but survival does not
exceed 14 months [3]. Symptomatic patients may bene-
fit from surgical resection of metastases in terms of
tumor-related symptoms and performance status [26].
Local radiation therapy has also been reported to
resolve cutaneous lesions, which did not respond to
chemotherapy [17].

Conclusions
This is a rare case of late presentation cutaneous metas-
tasis of transitional cell carcinoma. Metastatic disease
should always be considered in the differential diagnosis
in patients with a previous history of bladder cancer
who present with cutaneous nodules. This disease has a
broad clinical impact across medicine, in particular for
urologists, dermatologists, medical and radiation oncolo-
gists, general physicians, geriatricians and palliative care
specialists. In many cases, as in our patient, treatment is
mainly supportive and prognosis is poor. Due to its
rarity and poor survival rate, management strategies
have been difficult to define. Therefore, it is important
for the medical community to have access to each case,
through case reports, so as to advance our understand-
ing of this particular disease.
