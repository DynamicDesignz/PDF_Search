edema and simultaneous flash pulmonary edema
in a patient with idiopathic systemic capillary leak
syndrome: a case report

Abstract

Introduction: Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome is a rare and fatal disease due to the unexplained
episodic attacks of capillary leakage of plasma from the intravascular into the interstitial space. The attack consists of
three phases, a prodromal phase, peripheral leak phase and recruitment phase. During the peripheral leak phase,
generalized edema, mainly in the trunk and extremities, with hemoconcentration and hypoalbuminemia occurs,
while usually the visceral organs like lungs, brain, heart and kidneys seem not to be involved. Treatment of the
acute phase is supportive, focusing on adequate but not overzealous fluid resuscitation, because pulmonary edema
usually occurs in the recruitment phase.
Case presentation: A 65-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital because of severe hypovolemic
shock with metabolic acidosis and hemoconcentration and hypoalbuminemia. Although she was considered to be
in the peripheral leak phase of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome, which could not be diagnosed during
the treatment, the generalized edema worsened further, severe flash pulmonary edema progressed rapidly after
fluid resuscitation and she died. The autopsy showed generalized edema, especially alveolar pulmonary edema
without endothelial apoptosis.
Conclusions: Because hypovolemic shock and fatal pulmonary edema may progress rapidly together even in the
peripheral leak phase of idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome, we should keep in mind this rare and fatal
disease and recognize the pathophysiology to treat it effectively when the patient has hypovolemia with metabolic
acidosis.

Introduction
Idiopathic systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) is a
very rare disease with a high mortality rate. SCLS was first
described by Clarkson in 1960 [1]. Since then about 160
cases have been described [2-5]. The syndrome is charac-
terized by unexplained increased capillary permeability
resulting in generalized edema and hypovolemia with the
SCLS trio of hypotension, hemoconcentration and hypoal-
buminemia due to the marked shift of intravascular fluid

(up to 70%) and macromolecules like albumin from the
intravascular to the extravascular space [3]. The diagnosis
of SCLS is performed clinically by the exclusion of other
diseases that cause systemic capillary leakage. The mortal-
ity rate among SCLS patients has been reported to be as
high as 18 to 36% [5-8]. In one report, 75% of the deaths
were directly related to SCLS attacks [5]. We describe a
hypovolemic shock patient who was hospitalized without
a definitive diagnosis and died from the first severe attack
of SCLS. SCLS is a very rare and fatal disease, and so it is
very important to frequently emphasize the necessity of
recognizing the pathophysiology of SCLS [9].

Case presentation
A 65-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hos-
pital because of face and limb edema, back pain and se-
vere general fatigue. She had complained of the symptoms
of a cold with fever one week before admission. Her con-
sciousness was mildly disturbed, her blood pressure was
80/40mmHg, heart rate was 130/min, respiratory rate was
32 breaths/min and her body temperature was 35.6°C.
Lymphadenopathy was not detected. Skin flush, urticaria,
focal angioedema and stridor were not observed. Her
breath sounds and heart sounds were normal. An abdom-
inal examination showed cyanotic skin and slight tender-
ness on the right lower quadrant. Her extremities were
cold and markedly edematous. Laboratory data obtained
on admission showed the following values: white blood
cells 30,600/μL with a normal fraction, red blood cells
688×104/μL, hematocrit 67.2%, hemoglobin 22.1g/dL,
C-reactive protein 4.6mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen
43mg/dL, creatinine 2.2mg/dL, total protein 5.5g/dL, al-
bumin 3.1g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 34IU/L,
alanine transaminase (ALT) 25IU/L, alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) 220IU/L,
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 363IU/L,
creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 243IU/L, creatine kinase
MB (CK-MB) 27.0IU/L, D-dimer 0.8μg/mL, blood glucose
428mg/dL, sodium 130mEq/L, potassium 5.1mEq/L, and
HbA1c 6.2%. The laboratory test performed later showed
that monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG), rheumatoid fac-
tor, antinuclear antibody, and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) (<20pg/ml) were undetectable. Her arterial
blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH: 6.95,
−: 4.4mmol/L,
PO2: 102mmHg, PCO2: 21.3mmHg, HCO3
BE: −35.9mmol/L). A chest X-ray film was normal and a

plain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed no pleural
effusion, pulmonary congestion nor cardiomegaly but mild
pericardial effusion (Figure 1A, C). An electrocardiogram
(ECG, Figure 2B) showed the low voltage of the limb
leads, QS pattern in I and aVL, poor R wave progression
in V1 to 4 and ST elevation in V4 to 6, which were not
found in the electrocardiogram recorded one month pre-
viously (Figure 2A). A portable echocardiography examin-
ation was normal except for mild pericardial effusion and
the decreased diameter of the inferior vena cava. At this
time, we thought the severe hemoconcentration indicated
intravascular hypovolemia, which had caused the periph-
eral circulatory disturbances and the metabolic acidosis.
We started infusing extracellular fluids from a central vein
with intravenous administration of insulin according to
the sliding scale to correct the intravascular volume deficit
and to restore hemodynamic stability (Figure 3).

In spite of continuous intravenous infusion (total about
2000mL), her blood pressure dropped gradually and about
two hours later dropped suddenly to be undetectable, but
she could respond to our call. The more rapid infusion of
the extracellular fluid (about 1500mL) from a central vein
with use of the catecholamine (dopamine 5 to 10mcg/kg/
min) restored her blood pressure 30 minutes later and
then the contrast CT scan was taken. It did not show any
findings of pulmonary embolism and acute abdomen such
as acute pancreatitis, abscess, and mesentelic arterial oc-
clusion, but it showed pulmonary congestion and massive
edema of the whole body (Figure 1B, D), which were not
found by the first plain CT scan. At this time, the portable
echocardiography showed normal left ventricular wall mo-
tion. One hour after that, hemodynamic deterioration and

respiratory failure due to severe pulmonary edema pro-
gressed rapidly. Intratracheal intubation was done but the
water blew out from the tube and she died about one hour
later in spite of the aggressive treatment (Figure 3). The
laboratory test result on this hemodynamic deterioration
was reported after her death and showed the significant
progression of the hypoalbuminemia on the following la-
boratory data: white blood cells 38,000/μL with a normal
fraction, red blood cells 507×104/μL, hematocrit 45.6%,
hemoglobin 15.7g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 38mg/dL, cre-
atinine 2.3mg/dL, total protein 1.2g/dL, albumin 0.6g/dL,
AST 49IU/L, ALT 35IU/L, ALP 100IU/L, LDH 328IU/L,

CPK 543IU/L, blood glucose 226mg/dL, sodium 154mEq/L,
potassium 3.9mEq/L. Blood cultures were negative.

The autopsy showed generalized edema, especially alveo-
lar pulmonary edema without endothelial apoptosis. The
pulmonary alveolar spaces were filled with fluids, which
were not stained so much by hematoxylin and eosin. The
coronary arteries did not have any atherosclerotic stenosis.
Inflammatory cells were not found in the edematous tissues.
The bone marrow showed no evidence of multiple mye-
loma. There were no signs of infection.

She had a medical history of two previous episodes of
generalized edema and fatigue after antecedent flu-like

illness. She recovered without any medication. One month
before admission, the laboratory data of her regular medical
check was normal as per the following values: hemoglobin
12.7g/dL, protein 6.9g/dL, creatinine 0.78mg/dL, and blood
urea nitrogen 14.8mg/dL. After her death, we diagnosed
that our patient had had SCLS in consideration of all these
medical histories.

Discussion
We describe a 65-year-old woman who was hospitalized
because of severe hypovolemic shock with hemoconcen-
tration and hypoalbuminemia. Our case was similar to
other reports describing patients with SCLS and was diag-
nosed as severe SCLS according to the report by Gousseff
et al. [5]. SCLS is diagnosed clinically after exclusion of
other diseases that cause systemic capillary leakage, in-
cluding severe sepsis, toxic shock syndrome and anaphyl-
axis. In our patient, blood cultures were negative and
there were no findings of infection by autopsy, which indi-
cated she had not had sepsis. Her cutaneous and respira-
tory findings, and laboratory examinations, showed that
she had not had toxic shock syndrome and anaphylaxis.

SCLS attack consists of three phases, a prodromal phase,
peripheral leak phase and recruitment phase [3]. About
30% of SCLS patients show an antecedent upper respira-
tory tract infection or a flu-like illness with fever in the
prodromal phase, like our patient. One to four days after
the prodromal phase, the capillary leakage develops and re-
sults in generalized edema, mainly in the trunk and ex-
tremities, while the visceral organs like lungs, brain, heart
and kidneys usually seem not to be involved [3,5]. Some

patients have hypovolemic shock and ischemic end-organ
damage, which include acute kidney injury, ischemic brain
injury and ischemic hepatic dysfunction. The peripheral
leak phase continues for several days and the recruitment
phase begins quickly, in which massive fluid and macro-
molecules are recruited back from the third space into the
circulation. The patient is at high risk for intravascular vol-
ume overload and pulmonary edema during this recruit-
ment phase. The reported cases of the acute phase of
SCLS in the literature (from 1990 to 2011, [2,7,8,10-16])
are summarized in Table 1. Five out of 13 patients had pul-
monary edema, which occurred in the recruitment phase
in four of them and the other one patient had it in the per-
ipheral leak phase because of the iatrogenic effect of the
large amount of transfusion (case 10). Kapoor et al. evalu-
ated 25 patients with SCLS to determine clinical features,
natural history and outcome [4] Pulmonary edema devel-
oped in 10 out of 25 patients (40%) during the recovery
phase in the face of ongoing vigorous fluid resuscitation.
Therefore, in the peripheral leak phase, adequate organ
perfusion has to be obtained by sequential rapid and large
infusion of intravascular fluids if hypoperfusion exists. In
the recruitment phase, control of the fluid overload must
be performed with the use of diuretics and sometimes by
mechanical ventilation [3].

In SCLS, the endothelial barrier dysfunction leads to
leakage of the intravascular fluid and macromolecules like
albumin into the interstitial space. Although crystalloids
are used commonly as intravascular fluids, colloid (albu-
min) also should be used for the intravascular fluid resus-
citation in SCLS, because colloid increases intravascular

oncotic pressure and keeps the fluid in the intravascular
space for a longer period than crystalloid alone [3]. How-
ever, proteins like albumin, with a molecular weight less
than 200 kilodaltons, leak from the vessels in SCLS and
the effectiveness of colloid may not be enough. Recently, it
was reported that the infusion of 10% pentastarch, a larger
molecule than albumin, had the effect to stabilize the
hemodynamics in two SCLS patients with refractory
hypotension during the peripheral leak phase, who did not
respond to aggressive crystalloid replacement and ino-
tropic agents [13]. The pharmacologic therapies to im-
prove the capillary leakage were tried in the acute phase
of SCLS. Terbutaline, by inducing adenyl cyclase, and
theophylline, by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, increase the
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels of the
endothelium. The increase in cAMP is known to decrease
endothelial cell permeability [17], and so both are sup-
posed to interfere with capillary permeability. Beta-2
stimulators like terbutaline can also inhibit macromolecu-
lar leakage in response to histamine and bradikynin [18].
Theophylline also is known to antagonize cytokine-
mediated endothelial damage and capillary permeability
[19]. Through these pharmacologic activities, both terbu-
taline and theophylline are used as a first-line prophylactic
therapy against chronic SCLS [20]. In three patients with
acute phase SCLS, Dowden et al. showed that the com-
bination of terbutaline and theophylline had beneficial ef-
fects by decreasing capillary permeability if the serum
theophylline level was high enough (20 to 25mcg/mL),
and that if it did not work, the additional administration
of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonist
(infliximab) seemed to improve the patient refractory to
terbutaline and theophylline [21]. Lambert et al. reported
high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins were effective
against the acute phase of SCLS [22]. VEGF was reported
in 1983 to induce rapid leakage from blood vessels [23].
Recently, VEGF was reported to increase in the episodic
SCLS active phase but not in the remission phase [24,25].
Yabe et al. reported that anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizu-
mab) improved the life-threatening acute phase of SCLC
[26]. However, we need to be aware of SCLS and to diag-
nose it before using them, because these acute pharmaco-
logic challenges are not established and a TNF-alpha
antagonist is dangerous if patients have sepsis.

Our patient was hospitalized in the peripheral

leak
phase of SCLS with prolonged hypoperfusion, because she
had distributive shock with metabolic acidosis. Although
we did not have a definitive diagnosis, we started infusing
extracellular fluid (crystalloid) without colloid, and her
hemodynamics improved transiently. Usually, the lungs
may not be involved in the peripheral leak phase [3]. But
during the extracellular fluid infusion, the generalized
edema progressed and the severe flash pulmonary edema
also progressed rapidly, and she died (Figure 3). There

might be several possible explanations. The rapid decrease
in oncotic pressure due to severely progressing hypoalbu-
minemia and the increase in the pulmonary artery resist-
ance due to metabolic acidosis [27,28] and the aggressive
extravascular fluid resuscitation without colloid, all of
them might induce flash pulmonary edema. Although we
thought the serum albumin level of 3.1g/dL on admission
was mild, its level had to have been actually very low in
consideration of her severe hemoconcentration. The de-
gree of hypovolemia and systemic tissue hypoperfusion on
admission were also severe in consideration of her meta-
bolic acidosis and hemoconcentration, and so the pul-
monary capillary hydrostatic pressure was low enough not
to induce pulmonary edema in spite of her hypoalbumin-
emia on admission. Therefore, we should have understood
the pathogenesis of the SCLS and have transfused the ap-
propriate dose of colloids with crystalloids while moni-
toring the central venous pressure on admission and
performed mechanical ventilation with positive end-
expiratory pressure (PEEP) at the latest at the occurrence
of the first hemodynamic deterioration. The myocardial
involvement associated with the SCLS might be another
possibility [11,29,30]. Claessens et al. showed the revers-
ible biventricular wall thickening, while systolic function
remained normal by echocardiography. The ECG re-
vealed cardiac axial rotation of −30° with nonspecific re-
polarization abnormalities in the attacks of SCLS, as in
our patient [11]. Juthier et al. observed both myocardial
thickening and severe systolic dysfunction by echocardi-
ography, and diffuse myocardial interstitial edema with-
out inflammatory infiltrates and myocyte necrosis by
endomyocardial biopsies in the shock stage in one pa-
tient with SCLS [29]. In our patient, the autopsy findings
did not show myocardial interstitial edema.

The pathogenesis of SCLS is unknown. Some hypoth-
eses have been proposed, but hypotheses have incomplete
evidence [3]. About 80% of patients with SCLS have a
monoclonal
immunoglobulin in their serum and these
paraproteins might be related to the endothelial damage
and vascular leakage [5,8,31]. But our patient did not have
a monoclonal immunoglobulin. Some reports proposed
the role of the cytokines, because interleukin 2 (IL-2)-re-
ceptor positive cells and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)-
positive lymphocytes were found surrounding damaged
endothelial cells during attacks in one patient [32]. How-
ever, in our patient, we could not find the lymphocytes
around the capillaries of the autopsy tissues. VEGF is con-
sidered to be related to the pathogenesis of SCLS [23-25].
In our patient, VEGF was within normal limit. Therefore,
the etiology of our patient remains unknown.

Conclusions
It is important to keep in mind this rare and fatal disease
of SCLS and recognize the pathophysiology to treat it

effectively because severe hypovolemic shock and severe
flash pulmonary edema may progress rapidly together
during fluid resuscitation even in the peripheral
leak
phase of SCLS. To prevent these situations, intubation
and mechanical ventilation with PEEP and fluid resusci-
tation by appropriate dose of crystalloids with colloids
should be done while monitoring the central venous
pressure when hypoalbuminemia and systemic tissue hy-
poperfusion are considered to be severe from the grade
of hemoconcentration and metabolic acidosis.
