Abstract

Introduction: Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia is a rare morphological variant of thyroid
carcinoma associated with Hashimoto’s disease. To date, only three such tumors have been reported in the minor
salivary glands. We describe the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of recurrent sclerosing mucoepidermoid
carcinoma with eosinophilia in the minor salivary glands of the upper lip.
Case presentation: A 61-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with a mass in his median upper lip
of four years’ duration. An examination of his median upper lip revealed a well-defined tumor measuring 9×12mm
in diameter, which was subsequently resected. Three years after the first surgery, the tumor recurred and was resected.
Both tumors were confirmed by histopathology to be sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia. Neither
recurrence nor metastasis was observed in three and a half years of follow-up after the second surgery.
Conclusion: Our findings indicate that sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia can originate in the
minor salivary glands and may be clinically or pathologically misdiagnosed as other conditions.
Keywords: Lip cancer, Minor salivary glands, Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma, Tissue eosinophilia

Introduction
In 1991, sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eo-
sinophilia (SMECE) was proposed to be a rare morpho-
logical variant of
thyroid carcinoma associated with
Hashimoto’s disease [1]. Approximately 30 cases involv-
ing the thyroid have been reported in the literature.
Similar to thyroid lesions, SMECE occurring in the saliv-
ary glands generally has a lower malignancy and better
prognosis than conventional mucoepidermoid carcinoma
(MEC). To date, only three of these tumors have been
reported in the minor salivary glands. Here, we report
the case of a 61-year-old Japanese man with recurrent
SMECE in his median upper lip and present a review of
the relevant literature.

Case presentation
A 61-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital

duration. He had received interferon-ribavirin combin-
ation therapy for chronic hepatitis C several years earl-
ier. He had no history of any other illness.

Our patient was aware of the mass, which had slowly
grown over several years with occasional epithelial de-
tachment or bleeding; however, he never sought treat-
ment. The tumor was located in his median upper lip,
was well-defined, measured 9×12mm in diameter, and
was elastic, hard and ulcerated (Figure 1). Regional
lymph nodes were not palpable.

The tumor appeared to be benign from its appearance
and growth rate and was resected under local anesthesia.
Preoperative imaging such as computed tomography
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging was not performed
because the boundary of the lesion was clear. The tumor
surface was smooth and covered with a capsule-like
structure, and its cut surface was solid and pale yellow.
We assumed that it was a benign tumor such as an ath-
eroma or pleomorphic adenoma.

Beneath the erosive epithelium, small neoplastic nests
surrounded by markedly hyperplastic fibrous connective
tissue had formed. The tumor cells had pale eosinophilic

surgery was not performed at our patient’s request. We
performed contrast-enhanced CT of his neck and scin-
tigraphy of his whole body, neither of which revealed
any metastases. Considering the potential for metastasis
from the thyroid gland or autoimmune disease, blood
tests were also performed. He had no abnormalities in
his thyroid hormone levels (tri-iodothyronine, thyroxin
and thyroid-stimulating hormone), autoantibody levels
(antinuclear antibody, anti-Sjögren’s syndrome antigens A
and B), or whole-blood eosinophil count. Nevertheless,
we closely monitored our patient, with regular check-ups
every three months and contrast-enhanced CT imaging of
his cervical region once every year.

Three years after the first resection, a mass measuring
2mm in diameter was detected in the same region. Local
recurrence was suspected, and the tumor was resected
with a 5mm safety margin. Again, the resected specimen
was diagnosed on histopathology as SMECE. Its histo-
logic features were similar to those of the primary tumor
(Figure 4), with a lower density of fibrous connective
tissue. This specimen also had tumor-free margins on
histology. Its MIB-1 positivity rate was 5.8%.

A physical examination and contrast-enhanced CT of
his neck revealed no signs of recurrence or metastasis
three and a half years after the second surgery.

Discussion
SMECE is a rare variant of thyroid carcinoma, and only
approximately 30 cases have been reported to date. The
tumor is a low-grade malignancy with a good prognosis
[2]. In 1987, Chan and Saw [3] reported a low-grade
MEC showing an unusual pattern of extensive central
sclerosis in the parotid gland and termed it sclerosing
MEC. In their case, tissue eosinophils were not present.
Since then, 20 cases of tumors in the major salivary
glands and three of tumors in the minor salivary glands
have been reported [3-15]. In many of
these cases,

cytoplasm and round nuclei that included small nucleoli
(Figure 2). We also observed eosinophil-rich infiltrates
in the tumor nests, tubular structures containing peri-
odic acid-Schiff-positive mucus in the lumen, goblet
cells, and venous invasion (Figure 3). The specimen was
lined by normal muscular tissue.

We performed immunostaining of the resected speci-
men. The ductal structure was positive for epithelial
membrane antigen (EMA) and carcinoembryonic anti-
gen (CEA), and the solid structure was positive for cyto-
keratin. The mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1
(MIB-1)-positivity rate was 7.9%. There was no histo-
logical capsule; the macroscopic capsule-like structure
observed may have been connective tissue covering the
margin of the resected specimen.

On histopathology,

the tumor was diagnosed as
SMECE originating from the minor salivary glands of
the lip. Based on its MIB-1-positivity rate, we designated
the malignancy of the tumor as intermediate. On mi-
croscopy, the tumor nests were close to the surgical
margin: 1mm at the nearest point. However, additional

marked eosinophilic infiltration was observed (Table 1).
In the latest World Health Organization classification
[16], the sclerosing variant of MEC was mentioned;
however, eosinophilia associated with MEC was not
addressed.

On histopathology, SMECE consists of islands of can-
cer cells of low nuclear grade, with a sclerotic stroma
heavily infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells and eo-
sinophils. A mixture of mucinous epithelial cells and
glandular structures is also evident, and these compo-
nents can merge with the squamoid islands or form
discrete tubules [17].

Differential diagnoses of our case would include squa-
mous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous cell carcinoma,
low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma and microcys-
tic adnexal carcinoma.
Immunostaining for markers
such as EMA and CEA was useful for diagnosis. We
designated the malignancy of the first resected tumor as
intermediate on the basis of venous invasion and the
MIB-1-positivity rate.

From an epidemiological perspective, previous reports of
SMECE in the salivary glands have described its features as
similar to those of ordinary MEC, with more frequent oc-
currence in women (16 of 24 reported cases, including
ours), a wide age distribution (16 to 79 years) and predom-
inant occurrence in the parotid glands (17 cases).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of
SMECE in the minor salivary glands of the lip; it is also
the first case of local recurrence. Most reported cases
had a good therapeutic outcome, although one patient

developed lymph node metastasis and one died from
pulmonary metastasis [6]. According to our survey of
past reports, tumor-associated tissue eosinophilia is not
necessarily related to malignancy. In addition, cases in
which secondary metastasis occurred had a low grade of
malignancy. Although local excision was effective in
most cases, our experience suggests that SMECE has in-
vasive characteristics.

Many previous reports have classified tumors with eo-
sinophilic infiltration into carcinomas and lymphomas.
In past studies, tissue eosinophils have been suggested to
indicate an inflammatory host response against a tumor
or to be an eosinophilotactic factor derived from tumor
cells themselves; however, the mechanism underlying

eosinophilic infiltration remains unclear [18,19].
In
addition, reports on the prognosis of tumors with eosino-
philic infiltration are inconsistent

showed that eosinophils

stimulate
DNA synthesis in fibroblasts, and may be involved in
the remodeling of host connective tissue and blood ves-
sels in response to a growing tumor. The tissue sclerosis
and venous invasion evident in our case were probably a
result of eosinophilic infiltration.

Whether SMECE in the salivary glands represents a
distinct tumor type or merely a morphological variant of

conventional MEC remains controversial [17]. In most
cases with thyroid involvement, SMECE occurs in the
setting of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. However, consistent
with findings from other patients with salivary gland in-
volvement, our patient developed no complications such
as Sjögren’s syndrome or other autoimmune diseases.

In this case, we resected the tumor with no consider-
ation of the possibility of malignancy and subsequently
encountered recurrence three years later. Although it is
probable that the secondary tumor originated from re-
sidual tumor cells, its growth was slow. It was necessary
to perform the second surgery as soon as the diagnosis
was made because the surgical margin was close to the
tumor.

Conclusion
We reported a case of local recurrence of SMECE. Our
experience with the present case indicates that SMECE
can originate in the minor salivary glands and that this
rare variant of thyroid carcinoma may be clinically or
pathologically misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as
inflammatory lesions, benign metaplasia, or different
types of malignant tumor with tissue sclerosis. Although
the prognosis of SMECE is relatively good according to
published reports, we continue to monitor our patient
carefully.
