Abstract

Introduction: Spontaneous rupture of an ovarian artery aneurysm is extremely rare. Although a majority of these
cases have been associated with pregnancy, there have been recent reports and reviews of rare cases that were not
directly associated with pregnancy. Transcatheter arterial embolization is considered to be an alternative therapy to
surgery.
Case presentation: A 44-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 3 para 3, presented to our emergency room complaining
of intermittent right flank pain. She had undergone a cesarean section 2 years previously, and had no history of abdominal
trauma. On admission, her blood pressure was 115/78 mmHg, pulse 70 beats per minute, and hemoglobin concentration
9.8 g/dL. Abdominal ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced dynamic computed tomography revealed a large retroperitoneal
hematoma. Findings on three-dimensional computed tomography angiography suggested ruptured aneurysm of her
right ovarian artery. A selective right ovarian artery angiogram revealed a tortuous aneurysm. Transcatheter arterial
embolization using N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate was performed. The aneurysm was successfully embolized, and her course
after embolization was uneventful. She has remained symptom-free during 3 months of follow-up.
Conclusions: This was a very rare case of a patient who had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage originating from an ovarian
artery aneurysm. A review of published case reports found that contrast-enhanced computed tomography with
reconstruction images is an excellent imaging tool. Diagnostic angiography and subsequent transcatheter arterial
embolization are thought to be very effective for this condition.

Introduction
Spontaneous rupture of an ovarian artery aneurysm is
extremely rare; only 25 cases have been reported in the
English literature [1-24]. Although a majority of these
cases were related to pregnancy and occurred during the
peripartum or postpartum period, there have been recent
reports and reviews of rare cases that were not directly as-
sociated with pregnancy [7,14,16,18-20,22]. Rupture of
an ovarian artery aneurysm leads to retroperitoneal

hemorrhage and can be a life-threatening event. Accord-
ing to previously reported cases, life-saving treatment of a
ruptured ovarian artery consists of surgery that includes
ligation of the artery proximal and distal to the site of rup-
ture. However, since the first report by King [9], transcath-
eter arterial embolization (TAE) has emerged as an
alternative therapy for patients who are hemodynamically
stable. Here, we report the case of a patient with spontan-
eous retroperitoneal hemorrhage associated with rupture
of an ovarian artery aneurysm who was successfully
treated using TAE only. We also review the published case
reports on this rarely occurring condition.

Case presentation
A 44-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 3 para 3, who had
undergone cesarean section 2 years previously, presented
to our emergency room with a 2-day history of intermit-
tent right flank pain. She had no fever, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, or cough. She had no history of abdominal
trauma, and her past medical history and family history
were not significant. She did not have hypertension or car-
diovascular disease, and had not taken any anticoagulants.
Her bowel and urinary habits were normal, and her men-
strual periods were regular. Her last menstrual period had
begun 2 days before the onset of right flank pain. On ad-
mission, her blood pressure was 115/78 mmHg, pulse 70
beats per minute, body temperature 36°C, and blood oxy-
gen saturation 100%. She was found to be somewhat
anemic, with a hemoglobin concentration of 9.8 g/dL and
hematocrit of 28.2%. Her white blood cell count was ele-
vated (13,900/mm3), and a urine pregnancy test was
negative.

computed tomography

On physical examination, her abdomen was diffusely
tender without muscle guarding. A pelvic examination re-
vealed a small amount of menstrual discharge and a normal
uterus and bilateral adnexae. Abdominal ultrasonography
demonstrated a large retroperitoneal hematoma surround-
ing her right kidney (Figure 1A). Emergent abdominal and
pelvic
(CT) was performed.
Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT revealed a large retroperi-
toneal hematoma surrounding her right kidney with an en-
hancing round structure in the center of the hematoma in
the arterial phase (Figure 1B). Although extravasation in
the venous phase was not clear,
findings on three-
dimensional CT angiography were suggestive of a retroperi-
toneal hematoma due to rupture of an aneurysm of her
right ovarian artery (Figure 1C), and no other responsible
lesion was seen. A transfemoral angiography was per-
formed for arterial embolization under a clinical diagnosis
of bleeding from a right ovarian artery aneurysm. A select-
ive angiogram of her right ovarian artery revealed a tortu-
ous aneurysm near its origin from the aorta without
obvious active extravasation (Figure 2A). A 2.1-Fr micro-
catheter (Tangent™; Boston Scientific, USA) was advanced
into the orifice of the aneurysm, and 1mL of 16.7%
N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (NBCA) diluted in iodized oil
(Lipiodol®; Guerbet Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was manually
injected beyond the distal site of the aneurysm. A postem-
bolization angiogram showed complete occlusion of the
vessel (Figure 2B). No other aneurysm was found on
three-dimensional CT and angiography.

One day after TAE, CT was performed, which showed
that the hematoma had decreased in size, and there was
no sign of extravasation. In addition, her hemoglobin
and hematocrit were found to have dropped to 7.9 g/dL
and 24.1%, respectively. She was administered iron for 4
days, with a subsequent increase in hemoglobin and

surgical intervention was needed, and her course after
embolization was uneventful. She was discharged on the

fifth hospital day, and has remained symptom-free dur-
ing 3 months of follow-up.

Discussion
A retroperitoneal hematoma can be a life-threatening
event, as well as a surgical emergency. Abdominal
trauma, including iatrogenic injuries from surgical inter-
ventions such as inferior vena cava filter placement and
arterial puncture, is the most common cause of retro-
peritoneal hemorrhage. In addition, a ruptured aortic or
renal artery aneurysm, retroperitoneal tumors, and clot-
ting disorders have been mentioned as the main causes
of retroperitoneal hematoma [25].

The most common presenting symptom of retroperi-
toneal hematoma is acute abdominal or flank pain ac-
companied by clinical signs associated with bleeding.
However, the clinical picture is often nonspecific, and
the ruling out of acute abdomen, ureteral calculus, and
pyelonephritis is needed. In addition, pregnant patients
in the third trimester can be misdiagnosed with placen-
tal abruption or uterine rupture if they do not undergo
an adequate imaging examination such as contrast-
enhanced CT, although pregnancy is a relative contra-
indication to this procedure. The most common arterial
sites for ruptured aneurysm in order of frequency during
pregnancy are the aorta, cerebral arteries, splenic artery,
renal artery, coronary artery, and ovarian artery [26].

Based on a MEDLINE search of the English language
literature from 1963 to 2014, to the best of our know-
ledge, only 25 cases of spontaneous rupture of an ovar-
ian artery aneurysm have been reported [1-24]. Of these
reported cases, 18 cases (72%) were associated with
pregnancy (Table 1), and seven cases (28%) were not dir-
ectly related to pregnancy (Table 2). The patients whose
pregnancy and delivery history were available were all
multigravida. The ages of the patients with pregnancy-
related ruptured ovarian aneurysm ranged from 23 to 39
years (mean 33.6 and median 35 years), and the ages of
the other patients ranged from 45 to 69 years (mean
51.5 and median 49.5 years). There seemed to be no dif-
ference regarding the side of the body where the rup-
tured aneurysm occurred. Among pregnancy-related
patients, the aneurysm occurred on the left in eight and
right in 10 cases; and among the other patients, on the
left in five and right in three cases, including the present
case. The majority of ruptures occurred during the post-
partum period, which accounted for 14 out of 18 cases
(78%). The onset of rupture occurred during the third
trimester in two patients, who underwent cesarean sec-
tion followed by ovarian artery ligation.

Because a ruptured ovarian artery aneurysm mostly oc-
curs in women of high parity, the repeated hemodynamic
and endocrine changes during pregnancy are thought to

be the cause of arterial alterations that may lead to new
aneurysm formation and/or weakening of pre-existing an-
eurysms [4,26]. In addition to the physiologic changes of
pregnancy, hypertension might be a risk factor for rupture
of ovarian artery aneurysm [18].

In earlier reported cases, the diagnosis was always ob-
tained by exploratory laparotomy. Since Blachar et al.
[12] first reported on the use of contrast-enhanced CT
with reconstruction images, this imaging modality has
been found highly effective for the preoperative diagno-
sis of ruptured ovarian artery aneurysm.

Of 17 cases published in 1990 or later, TAE was attempted
as a treatment for ruptured ovarian artery aneurysm in 11
cases (64.7%), and the procedure was successful in nine

cases, including ours. Because these patients had good
outcomes after a minimally invasive procedure, TAE is
currently considered to be the treatment of choice. The
following embolic agents have been used in the previous
reports; microcoils in five cases [9,11,17,19,21], gelatin
sponge particles (GSPs) in one case [24], a combination of
microcoils and GSP in one case [16], and NBCA was re-
cently used in one case [23]. Our patient is the second
case whose ruptured ovarian artery aneurysm was suc-
cessfully treated using NBCA.

The mechanism of embolization by microcoil and GSP
involves thrombin formation, which requires normal
clotting function. However, NBCA occludes blood ves-
sels because it polymerizes on contact with plasma, and

therefore this method does not depend on the patient’s
hemostatic capacity. Yonemitsu et al. evaluated the out-
comes of TAE performed using microcoils, GSP, and
NBCA in the setting of coagulopathy. They reported that
the rate of primary hemostasis was significantly higher
in patients undergoing NBCA compared to GSP, and the
mean treatment time was significantly shorter for the
NBCA procedure compared to the microcoil procedure
[27]. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider NBCA as the
embolic agent of choice for ruptured ovarian artery
aneurysm, especially for critical patients in shock, who
tend to have clotting problems due to coagulopathy. Be-
cause most patients with ovarian artery aneurysm are
asymptomatic and rupture is an uncommon event, this
condition may be underdiagnosed, and the risk factors for
rupture have not yet been studied in depth. Additional
case reports may help clarify the nature of ovarian artery
aneurysms.

Conclusions
We presented a very rare case of a patient who had a
retroperitoneal hemorrhage that originated from an
ovarian artery aneurysm. Contrast-enhanced CT with re-
construction images has been found to be an excellent
imaging tool. Diagnostic angiography combined with
subsequent TAE during the same imaging session is
thought to be a useful and highly effective alternative
therapeutic procedure for this condition. Because ovarian
arteries are potential sources of pelvic hemorrhage, these
vessels should be routinely studied when imaging demon-
strates the presence of a retroperitoneal hematoma, espe-
cially in multiparous women, whether or not they are
pregnant.
