Emphysematous cystitis presenting as severe
confusion and abdominal pain: two case reports
Vincent De Coninck* and Dirk Michielsen

Abstract

Introduction: Emphysematous cystitis is a very rare complicated urinary tract infection characterized by air in the
bladder wall.
Case presentation: We report two clinical cases of emphysematous cystitis of an 83-year-old Caucasian woman
with diabetes mellitus and a 78-year-old Caucasian man with no past medical history. They presented with severe
confusion and abdominal distension. Emphysematous cystitis was diagnosed in time with a thorough physical
examination, urine analysis and computed tomography. The patients were successfully treated with antibiotic therapy
and bladder drainage.
Conclusion: This rare disorder should be recognized in time and treated properly to guarantee survival.
Keywords: Computed tomography, Diabetes mellitus, Emphysematous cystitis, Pneumaturia, Urinary tract infection

Introduction
Emphysematous cystitis is a very rare urinary tract in-
fection. Two cases presenting as severe confusion and
abdominal pain are described. Patients should be diag-
nosed in time by performing a thorough physical exam-
ination and selecting accurate diagnostic tests.

Cases presentation
Case one
An 83-year-old Caucasian woman was referred by her
general practitioner to our emergency department due
to agitation and hallucination. Because of pyuria and
haematuria on dipsticks, the general practitioner started
ciprofloxacin 5 days earlier.

She had a medical history of Parkinson disease, atrial

flutter, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus.

A physical examination revealed severe confusion, dehy-
dration, abdominal distension and suprapubic tenderness.
Blood analysis revealed prerenal acute kidney failure
(creatinine 2.24mg/dL, urea 98mg/dL), signs of infection
(C-reactive protein 30mg/dL, serum white blood count
17200/mm3) and a well-controlled glycaemia (glycated
haemoglobin, A1c, 48mmol/mol).

Urine analysis disclosed leukocyturia, bacteriuria and

540 red blood cells per field.

Because of

the abdominal

findings, an abdominal
ultrasonography was performed. This showed irregular
thickening of her bladder wall with extensive intramural
echogenic foci (Figure 1).

In addition, a computed tomography was performed.
This showed intraluminal air and emphysematous changes
of her bladder wall (Figure 2).

Parenteral ciprofloxacin was continued and a 16 Fr
Foley catheter was inserted for optimal drainage. After
catheterization, pneumaturia was observed.

A retrograde cystography was performed to exclude
fistulas. This showed air at the posterior surface of her
bladder and an irregular bladder wall with delineated
radiolucent areas (Figure 3).

To exclude outlet obstruction, a uroflowmetry was
done. This examination revealed a micturition of 44mL
with a maximum flow of 4.5mL/second. The contribu-
tion of this examination was limited because of the low
micturition volume. Post-mictional residue was 250mL
(Figure 4).

Cystoscopy revealed inflammatory lesions, diverticula

and trabeculation (Figure 5).

After 3 days, Escherichia coli resistant to ciprofloxacin
but sensitive to temocillin was cultured at more than
1×106 colony-forming units/mL, so intravenous antibi-
otics were switched to the latter.

After 10 days she recovered. Her bladder catheter
was removed and antibiotics were stopped. A repeat
urine culture was sterile and she was sent home with
clean intermittent catheterization. Nitrofurantoin was
prescribed in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infec-
tions. A follow-up consultation at 4 weeks was ar-
ranged for uroflowmetry control. This examination
revealed bladder
function recovery with no post-
mictional residue, so clean intermittent catheterization
was stopped (Figure 6).

Case two
A 78-year-old Caucasian man with an adenocarcinoma of the
pancreas was hospitalized for a pancreaticoduodenectomy.

He has no past medical history. Four days after surgery,
the bladder catheter was removed with subsequent nor-
mal micturition. One week after the Whipple procedure,
he became aggressive, had severe confusion and abdom-
inal pain. Abdominal palpation revealed diffuse tender-
ness without peritoneal signs. Laboratory testing showed
a serum white blood count of 20200/mm3. Urine ana-
lysis showed significant leukocyturia and bacteriuria
without haematuria. Because of the disturbing abdom-
inal examination, abdominopelvic computed tomog-
raphy was performed. This revealed emphysematous
changes in his bladder wall (Figures 7 and 8).

Intravenous ciprofloxacin was started and a bladder
catheter was replaced. After catheterization, pneuma-
turia was not observed. After 3 days, more than 1×106
colony-forming units/mL E. coli sensitive to ciprofloxa-
cin was cultured. His abdominal pain and confusion dis-
appeared after 2 days. After 1 week of treatment with
antibiotics and bladder catheterization, his bladder wall
returned to normal on computed tomography scanning
of his abdomen.

Conclusions
Emphysematous cystitis is a rare disorder characterized by
air in the bladder wall and lumen. The triggers and cellular
mechanisms of this complicated urinary tract infection are
unclear. Gas in the bladder wall is probably produced by
natural fermentation of glucose by bacteria.

Older women with uncontrolled diabetes are at
highest risk of developing emphysematous cystitis. A
2:1 female to male predominance is noticed and two-
thirds of reported cases are diabetics. However, this
complicated urinary tract
infection should not be
overlooked in non-diabetic male patients as presented
in the second case. Other risk factors comprise urin-
ary tract obstruction,
indwelling urinary catheters,
chronic urinary tract
infections, neurogenic bladder
or immunosuppression [1].

Presentation can vary from asymptomatic to severe sep-
sis. More than half of patients present with abdominal

pain, classic symptoms of acute cystitis and pneumaturia.
Although pneumaturia appears to be a highly specific
symptom,
it is a rare patient complaint [2]. However,
pneumaturia was observed after bladder catheterization
in the first case. Both patients presented with severe

confusion. This atypical symptom should always be further
investigated as it can be the only sign of severe illness.

Urine analyses and Gram staining are essential in man-
aging patients with cystitis emphysematosa. Laboratory
testing usually reveals positive urine cultures with E. coli
or Klebsiella pneumoniae involving 80% of cases [3]. In
the first case accurate treatment was delayed because of
E. coli resistance to ciprofloxacin.

The severity and extent of emphysematous cystitis is
best defined by computed tomography. Because of the
increased use of computed tomography, emphysematous
cystitis is often incidentally diagnosed. Images are char-
acterized by multiple gas foci in a diffuse collection of
gas within the thickened bladder wall.

When performing ultrasonography or plain films of
the abdomen, air surrounding the bladder can be seen in
most cases.

Cystoscopy may show submucosal emphysema and

can be suggestive for bladder outlet obstruction.

The impeded flow from the bladder to the urethra can

be confirmed by uroflowmetry.

Cystography can show irregular thickening of the bladder
wall, representing submucosal blebs of air. Furthermore, it

is the most sensitive imaging modality to exclude other
causes of pneumaturia like enterovesical fistula [4].

In most cases, this gas-forming infection can be treated
with antibiotics and bladder catheterization for optimal
drainage. Of course, underlying medical conditions and

glycaemic levels in diabetics should be controlled as
well. In case of haematuria that includes blood clots or
necrotizing tissue, bladder irrigation or transurethral
debridement might be necessary. Emphysematous cyst-
itis seldom requires (partial) cystectomy [2].

If not diagnosed in time, cystitis emphysematosa may
result in urosepticaemia and even in death in up to 7%
of patients [5].
