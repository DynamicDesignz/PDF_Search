Simultaneous occurrence of a severe
Morel-Lavallée lesion and gluteal muscle
necrosis as a sequela of transcatheter
angiographic embolization following pelvic
fracture: a case report

Abstract

Introduction: Morel-Lavallée lesions are posttraumatic hemolymphatic collections caused by disruption of the
interfascial planes between the subcutaneous soft tissue and muscle. Severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions have
rarely been reported in the literature. By contrast, a number of cases of gluteal muscle necrosis following transcatheter
angiographic embolization for pelvic fracture have been reported. Each entity can result in severe infection and sepsis,
and the mortality rate in such cases is quite high. However, to date, no previous reports have described a case in which
these life-threatening entities occurred simultaneously.
Case presentation: A 32-year-old Asian man simultaneously developed severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions and
gluteal muscle necrosis with sepsis following transcatheter angiographic embolization after an unstable pelvic fracture.
Extremely large skin and soft tissue defects, which were untreatable with any commonly used flaps, were generated
after repeated debridement. In addition, a deep-bone infection was suspected in his left fractured iliac bone, while
motor function was almost completely lost in his left leg, possibly as a sequela of transcatheter angiographic
embolization. As a result of his condition, a left hemipelvectomy was unavoidable. A pedicled fillet flap from his
sacrificed left limb was used for the treatment of the defects and to provide a durable base for a prosthesis. Our patient
survived and returned to his previous job 24 months after the surgery wearing a prosthetic left leg.
Conclusion: As illustrated by the present case, severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions and gluteal muscle necrosis
following transcatheter angiographic embolization can occur simultaneously after unstable pelvic fractures. Physicians
should recognize that these entities can result in life-threatening sepsis and, therefore, should attempt to detect them
as early as possible. When hemipelvectomy is unavoidable, a pedicled upper and lower leg in-continuity fillet flap may
provide satisfactory outcomes.

Introduction
The Morel-Lavallée lesion was first described in the
mid-nineteenth century as a ‘closed degloving injury’ in
the proximal thigh [1]. More particularly, the condition
was characterized as a traumatic separation and hemo-
lymphatic collection between the subcutaneous soft tis-
sue and muscle. Subsequently, the term has been used
in the literature to describe similar lesions in other parts
of the body. However, to date, only one previous report
has described a large life-threatening Morel-Lavallée le-
sion complicated with sepsis after pelvic trauma [2].

Unstable pelvic fracture is a critical injury with a re-
ported mortality rate of 6.4% to 30% [3-6]. Margolies
et al. first described the successful treatment of a patient
with this condition using transcatheter angiographic
embolization (TAE), and this technique has subsequently
proven to be one of the most useful methods for con-
trolling hemorrhage associated with pelvic fracture [7].
However, gluteal muscle necrosis caused by TAE has
been reported for cases in which embolization of the bi-
lateral internal iliac arteries was required because of un-
controlled bleeding [8,9]. In particular, Takahira et al.
reported that five of 151 patients (3.3%) who underwent
bilateral iliac TAE for pelvic fracture developed gluteal
muscle necrosis [8]. In such cases, the development of
sepsis has typically proven fatal. Lower limb paresis as a
sequela of TAE of the iliac artery has also been reported
[10].

We present here a case of a severe Morel-Lavallée le-
sion with sepsis in a 32-year-old Asian man after an un-
stable pelvic fracture. Our patient also had severe gluteal
muscle necrosis and left lower limb paresis following
TAE. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no
previous reports of patients with simultaneous severe
Morel-Lavallée lesions and gluteal muscle necrosis as a
sequela of TAE. We describe a method for the recon-
struction of an extremely large soft-tissue defect that
achieved satisfactory outcomes in our case.

Case presentation
A healthy 32-year-old Asian man was involved in a
major road traffic accident. On admission, a pelvic X-ray
showed an unstable fracture of his left pelvis (AO classi-
fication type C1-3) and fractures of the lumbar trans-
verse processes (Figure 1). He was in hemorrhagic shock
due to retroperitoneal bleeding. No injuries were ob-
served in his head or chest. An experienced radiologist
performed emergency TAE of his internal
iliac artery
using a hemostatic gelatin sponge (Spongel) to control
the bleeding. However, embolization of his bilateral in-
ternal iliac arteries was needed to control the bleeding
successfully.

Over the course of seven days, skin erosions on both
buttocks advanced to necrosis (Figure 2). Computed

tomography (CT) showed left gluteal muscle damage
and a massive bilateral collection of fluid and gas be-
tween the gluteal muscles and subcutaneous soft tissue
(Figure 3). Our patient also developed sepsis. Emergency
surgical debridement was undertaken, and a massive
amount of brownish pus was drained from the subcuta-
neous cavity. His left gluteal muscle seemed to be

soft-tissue defect. Our patient and his family agreed to
this procedure. On day 95, we performed the surgical
procedure with urologists and plastic surgeons, attempt-
ing reconstruction with the lower leg pedicled fillet flap
subsequent
to the hemipelvectomy. An incision was
placed to harvest a vascularized fillet flap containing all
the muscles and skin of the left upper leg, the gastrocne-
mius and the soleus muscles, and a medial pedis flap.
The pedicle of the flap included the femoral, popliteal
and posterior tibial arteries. Next, we performed the left
hemipelvectomy, and then removed all of the bones of
his left lower limb (Figure 5). Consequently, the bilateral
gluteal defects were almost filled using the pedicled fillet
flap (Figure 6). The remaining skin defect was covered
with a split-thickness skin graft harvested from his am-
putated lower limb. The operation took 12 hours.

After the operation, several minor surgeries were needed
to promote wound-healing. Six months after surgery, the
wound was completely healed (Figure 7), and our patient
was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation. At 24
months post-surgery, he had successfully returned to his
previous office work wearing a prosthetic left leg.

Discussion
In the present case, the pathology underlying the severe
peripelvic lesion can be explained by considering three
entities: the Morel-Lavallée lesions, the gluteal muscle
necrosis following TAE, and direct contusion. In particu-
lar, the CT image on the seventh day revealed subcuta-
neous fluid collection and left gluteal muscle damage,
indicating both Morel-Lavallée lesions and direct contu-
sion. The intra-operative findings indicated right gluteal
muscle necrosis as a sequela of the TAE. To the best of
our knowledge, no previous reports have described a

severely damaged, and some areas of his bilateral gluteal
muscles also appeared to be necrotic. A variety of bacteria
(Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa) was grown from a culture of the pus. On day
11, a tracheostomy was performed. Several debridements
were subsequently performed, and we removed almost all
of his bilateral gluteal muscles. This exposed his left frac-
tured iliac bone, which was suspected of having a deep-
bone infection (Figure 4). As a result of the debridement,
an extensive soft-tissue defect was created in his buttocks
and extended into his thighs. Additionally, left lower limb
paresis became obvious as our patient’s level of conscious-
ness improved. Both sensory and motor function were al-
most completely lost in his left leg.

Based on our patient’s condition, sacrificing his para-
limb was considered the only option for
lyzed left
achieving a satisfactory outcome. In particular, it would
allow the extensive soft-tissue defect to be appropriately
covered, and good ambulatory function was anticipated
based on the use of a prosthesis. Therefore, we sug-
gested hemipelvectomy and the use of a pedicled fillet
flap from the sacrificed left limb for treatment of the

detecting the fluid collections and underlying muscle con-
tusion or laceration, as described by some authors, and
can be easily performed in patients in shock [12,13]. In
light of the present case, an important recognition is that
Morel-Lavallée lesions resulting from high-energy injuries
can be potentially severe.

Suzuki et al. found that initial traumatic contusion of
the gluteal muscles tends to contribute to the develop-
ment of necrosis [14]. MRI or CT may confirm whether
subclinical damage to the gluteal muscles is present. If
TAE is needed in a case in which a high risk of necrosis
is expected based on CT or MRI, selective TAE should
be performed [9].

Both Morel-Lavallée lesions and TAE induce the devel-
opment of peripelvic soft-tissue ischemia and increase the
risk of contamination of any hematoma, with subsequent
abscess formation and risk of sepsis [15]. In such severe
cases, an open approach and extensive debridement should
be performed. However, percutaneous drainage with or
without sclerotherapy or vacuum-assisted therapy may be
indicated in minor cases [16,17]. In our case, frequent daily
debridement with pulsatile irrigation in the intensive care
unit was needed after the first surgical debridement and
open drainage, in conjunction with the administration of
broad-spectrum antibiotics. Thus, the successful healing of
severe peripelvic soft-tissue infection requires substantial
resources in terms of manpower, material and patience.

The use of free flaps (for example, the rectus abdominis
musculocutaneous flap, anterolateral thigh flap and latissi-
mus dorsi muscle) and the free fillet lower leg flap have
been reported for the reconstruction of extensive defects
after hemipelvectomy or exenteration of a malignancy, with
the latter type of flap particularly utilized for hemipelvect-
omy [18-22]. Butler described the efficiency of the pedicled
upper and lower leg in-continuity fillet flap for reconstruc-
tion of an extensive hemipelvectomy defect [23]. We used
this pedicled fillet flap in the reconstruction for our patient
based on the following reasoning: the defect in this case
was too extensive to be covered using the above-mentioned
free flaps; because his left fractured pelvis was complicated
by a deep-bone infection and his left leg was almost com-
pletely nonfunctional, hemipelvectomy was unavoidable if
our patient was to achieve complete recovery and good am-
bulatory function; and the defect needed to be covered with
a solid flap with sufficient endurance for full weight-bearing
if out patient was to wear a prosthesis following the hemi-
pelvectomy. Indeed, no choice other than the chosen pro-
cedure (hemipelvectomy and fillet flap from the sacrificed
limb) appeared able to resolve the aforementioned prob-
lems. A possible explanation for our patient’s left lower
limb paresis is ischemia of the sciatic nerve as a sequela of
TAE, though direct damage in the initial unstable pelvic
fracture might also have contributed to this complication,
as described by Suzuki et al. [10].

case in which these life-threatening conditions were
superimposed.

With respect to the present report, only one case of a
severe Morel-Lavallée lesion in the pelvis has been re-
ported in the literature [2]. Phillips et al. stated that obes-
ity may increase the risk of developing Morel-Lavallée
lesions because it can lead to increased vulnerability of the
perforating arteries [2]. In addition, the increased amount
of subcutaneous fat may generate a greater shearing force.
Because our patient was not obese and did not have any
medical history, the seriousness of the lesion was attrib-
uted to an extremely high shearing force generated toward
both sides of his buttocks. Morel-Lavallée lesions should
have been noticed as early as possible, because its early de-
tection and management might have prevented sepsis by
controlling the local overgrowth and subsequent dissemin-
ation of bacteria. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is
considered a reliable modality for describing effusions and
determining the lesion type [11]. However, MRI was diffi-
cult to perform in our case because of our patient’s state
of shock. Ultrasound could be a useful diagnostic tool for

Our patient described typical phantom limb pain, and
rehabilitation was very challenging for him. However, he
returned to his previous occupation 24 months after sur-
gery. Some authors have reported that 68% to 72% of pa-
tients who undergo surgery for pelvic fracture return to
their jobs, with a mean duration of follow-up of 35 to 47
months [24,25]. In the context of these reports, our case
achieved quite satisfactory outcomes.

Conclusions
Severe peripelvic Morel-Lavallée lesions and gluteal muscle
necrosis following TAE can occur simultaneously after un-
stable pelvic fractures. Physicians should recognize that
these entities can result in life-threatening sepsis and, there-
fore, should attempt to detect them as early as possible. In
a case in which hemipelvectomy is unavoidable, the pedi-
cled upper and lower leg in-continuity fillet flap may pro-
vide satisfactory outcomes.
