Abstract 

Introduction 

Obstructive sleep apnea and opioid-induced respiratory depression can unpredictably threaten 
respiratory competence in the post-anesthesia care unit. Current respiratory monitoring relies 
heavily  on  respiratory  rate  and  oxygen  saturation,  as  well  as  subjective  clinical  assessment. 
These  assessments  have  distinct  limitations,  and  none  provide  a  real-time,  objective, 
quantitative  direct  measurement  of  respiratory  status.  A  novel,  non-invasive  respiratory 
volume monitor uses bioimpedance to provide accurate, quantitative measurements of minute 
ventilation,  tidal  volume  and  respiratory  rate  continuously  in  real  time,  providing  a  direct 
measurement of ventilation. 

Case presentation 

The  case  describes  an  orthopedic  surgery  patient  (54-year-old  Caucasian  man,  body  mass 
index  33.7kg/m2)  with  diagnosed  obstructive  sleep  apnea  in  whom  the  respiratory  volume 
monitor  data  depicted  persistent  apneic  behavior  undetected  by  other  monitoring.  The 
monitor  was  able  to  detect  a  sudden  reduction  in  minute  ventilation  after  initial  opioid 
administration  in  the  post-anesthesia  care  unit.  The  patient  had  sustained  low  minute 
ventilation until discharge. Neither respiratory rate data from the hospital monitor nor oxygen 
saturation readings reflected the respiratory decompensation, remaining within normal limits 
even during sustained low minute ventilation. 

Conclusions 

The  events  of  this  case  illustrate  the  limitations  of  current  respiratory  rate  monitoring  and 
pulse  oximetry  in  the  evaluation  of  post-surgical  respiratory  status.  Our  patient  displayed 
stable  respiratory  rate  and  no  evidence  of  desaturation,  despite  sustained  low  minute 
ventilation,  and  he  received  opioids  in  the  post-anesthesia  care  unit  despite  already 
compromised ventilation. Because the available monitoring did not indicate the patient’s true 
respiratory  status,  he  was  treated  with  additional  opioids,  markedly  increasing  his  risk  for 
further respiratory decline.

Introduction 

Management of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a growing concern in peri-operative care. It 
is  estimated  that  one  in  four  men  and  one  in  ten  women  have  OSA,  with  the  prevalence 
among  surgery  candidates  exceeding  that  of  the  general  population  [1].  Population-based 
studies  suggest  that  patients  presenting  for  orthopedic  surgery  with  OSA  are  at  greater  risk 
for post-operative pulmonary complications [2,3]. OSA is also substantially under diagnosed 
[4,5], and increasing evidence suggests that classic indicators such as age, body mass index 
and patient sex may in fact have little correlation with OSA prevalence or the manifestation 
of apnea post-operatively [6,7]. As a result, assessing individual patient risk for apnea can be 
difficult. 

Disordered  breathing  is  not  the  only  threat  to  respiratory  competence  in  the  post-anesthesia 
care  unit  (PACU).  In  addition  to  the  effects  of  surgical  insult  and  anesthesia,  narcotics 
administered  for  the  management  of  pain  can  lead  to  opioid-induced  respiratory  depression 
(OIRD)  or,  as  described  by  the  Anesthesia  Patient  Safety  Foundation,  opioid-induced 
ventilatory  insufficiency  (OIVI)  [8,9].  The  potential  synergy  between  unpredictable  apneic 
and  hypopneic  events  and  OIVI  is  a  significant  threat  to  patient  safety.  Care  providers 
typically  rely  on  a  combination  of  oxygen  saturation,  respiratory  rate  (RR)  and  subjective 
clinical  assessment  to  evaluate  respiratory  status  in  the  PACU,  but  these  are  only  surrogate 
indicators  of  ventilatory  drive.  Without  a  direct,  objective  measurement  of  ventilation, 
clinical  personnel  cannot  accurately  quantify  the  effects  of  disordered  breathing  or  drug 

administration on respiratory sufficiency. There is a need for a cost-effective, evidence-based, 
real-time solution to these challenges. 

A novel, non-invasive respiratory volume monitor (RVM) has been developed that produces 
continuous  digital  volume  traces  and  accurately  reports  minute  ventilation  (MV),  tidal 
volume (TV) and RR in non-intubated patients. Continuous MV measurements provide direct 
assessment of respiratory function and can quantify apnea and respiratory deterioration in real 
time.  Use  of  RVM 
is  consistent  with  current  American  Society  of 
Anesthesiologists guidelines for monitoring of ventilation in the PACU [10] and can provide 
health care professionals with a more complete assessment of respiratory status. 

technology 

Here we report a case of a patient  who experienced a substantial  reduction in  ventilation  in 
response  to  a  single  opioid  dose  in  the  PACU.  RR  and  pulse  oximetry  were  insufficient  to 
detect the potential threat to patient safety. 

Case presentation 

A 54-year-old Caucasian man (weight, 116kg; height, 185cm body mass index, 33.7 kg/m2) 
underwent left total hip replacement surgery under general anesthesia. A bioimpedance-based 
RVM (ExSpiron, Respiratory Motion, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was used to collect digital 
respiratory  traces  via  an  electrode  PadSet  placed  on  the  thorax  (Figure  1),  beginning  pre-
operatively  and  continuing  until  PACU  discharge,  for  a  total  of  418  minutes  (106  minutes 
pre-operatively,  192  intra-operatively  and  120  minutes  in  the  PACU).  MV,  TV  and  RR 
measurements were calculated every 5 seconds for the duration of this period from 30-second 
segments collected in  a sliding window. The clinical staff were blinded to RVM data. Vital 
sign measurements and pulse oximetry readings were obtained as part of routine patient care 
and were available to caregivers for ongoing patient management.

that provides continuous, real-time, non-invasive measurements of minute ventilation, tidal 
volume and respiratory rate. This photograph shows standard electrode placement on an 
obese patient (not the patient reported here; body mass index, 36.7 kg/m2). One electrode is 
placed at the sternal notch, another on the xiphoid and the third in the right mid-axillary line 
at the level of the xiphoid. 

The patient’s past medical history was positive for OSA, with no other respiratory conditions. 
The patient owned a home model of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device but 
had not been using it. In the pre-operative holding area, the patient was very sleepy, though 
not yet sedated. The RVM trace showed sustained, visible manifestations of apnea over this 
period (Figure 2B). Clinical personnel had no way to observe these apneic episodes and were 
unaware  of  the  patient’s  disordered  breathing.  No  snoring  or  physical  indications  of 
obstruction were observed. The patient was taken to the operating room, where sedation was 
induced with 300 mg of propofol and 250 μg of intravenous (IV) fentanyl and intubated after 
receiving 50 mg of IV rocuronium. Two 0.5 mg doses of hydromorphone were administered 
in  the  15  minutes  after  incision,  along  with  three  additional  doses  of  rocuronium  (20mg, 
10mg, 10mg) over the subsequent hour. Surgery lasted 134 minutes, after which the patient 
was extubated and transferred to the PACU.

sudden drop in ventilation that is not reflected in either RR or oxygen saturation levels. TV, 
Tidal volume. 

Within 20 minutes of PACU arrival, prior to receiving any post-operative opioids, the patient 
began  to  exhibit  apneic  events  lasting  up  to  45  seconds  (Figure  2C).  As  in  pre-operative 
holding,  no  outward  indications  of  disordered  breathing  were  observed.  Using  a  standard 
formula  based  on  ideal  body  weight  [11],  the  patient’s  predicted  minute  ventilation 
(MVPRED),  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  maintain  blood  oxygen  and  carbon  dioxide  levels 
under  baseline  conditions,  was  calculated  to  be  7.9  L/min.  Previous  research  has  described 
ventilation  below 80% of MVPRED prior to opioid administration as putting  a patient  at  risk 
for  OIRD  (MV  <40%  of  MVPRED),  a  potential  threat  to  patient  safety  [7].  Our  patient’s 
average MV, as measured by the RVM during the 5 minutes of stable breathing prior to  an 
initial PACU opioid administration, was 3.70 L/min, 44% of MVPRED. 

At  this  point,  the  patient  received  an  isolated,  nurse-administered  dose  of  hydromorphone 
(0.4 mg). This  was followed by an immediate reduction in  ventilation, with  average MV of 
only 2.37 L/min (28% of MVPRED) in the subsequent 5 minutes (Figure 2F). The patient’s RR 
gave no indication of compromise, remaining between 12 and 18 breaths per minute for the 
duration  of  this  period  and  even  showing  a  slight  increase  after  hydromorphone 
administration (Figure 2E). Blinded to the RVM data and with no way to objectively evaluate 
ventilation, clinical personnel continued to administer opioids to manage pain in accordance 
with  standard  practice.  The  patient  received  a  second  nurse-administered  hydromorphone 
dose  (0.4  mg)  40  minutes  after  the  first.  He  was  then  provided  with  a  patient-controlled 
analgesia  (PCA)  device  and  received  three  PCA  doses  (0.2  mg  hydromorphone  each)  in 
under 1 hour, before being discharged to a general care unit 118 minutes after PACU arrival 
(Figure 2E). MV remained low (<40% MVPRED) for the duration of the patient’s PACU stay 
and was still reduced upon discharge. RVM monitoring was discontinued at that time. 

Discussion 

The events of this case illustrate the limitations of RR monitoring and pulse oximetry in the 
evaluation  of  post-surgical  respiratory  status.  With  a  stable  RR  and  no  evidence  of 
desaturation,  our  patient  received  opioids  in  the  PACU  in  spite  of  already  compromised 
ventilation.  The  compromised  ventilation  was  not  able  to  be  immediately  appreciated  by 
clinical personnel. RR and oxygen saturation provided no forewarning of potential respiratory 

insufficiency,  and  the  patient  was  treated  with  additional  opioids,  markedly  increasing  the 
risk  for  further  respiratory  decline.  The  patient  was  discharged  to  a  general  hospital  floor 
without  indication  of  the  need  for  continuous  respiratory  monitoring,  despite  sustained  low 
ventilation and additional opioid doses in the closing minutes of his PACU stay. Fortunately, 
he experienced no adverse events. 

All clinical decisions in  this case were made according to standard protocols. Any potential 
threat to patient safety was not the result of substandard care, but rather was due to inherent 
pitfalls  in  established  respiratory  monitoring  technology  and  practice.  In  this  case,  the 
commonly  used  respiratory  monitoring  (RR  and  peripheral  capillary  oxygen  saturation)  did 
not suggest respiratory compromise, despite persistent low MV after opioid administration. If 
RVM  data  had  been  available,  the  patient’s  initial  respiratory  depression  would  have  been 
noted and the patient’s opioid regimen might have been adjusted or a multimodal approach to 
analgesia  might  have  been  pursued.  Low  MV  readings  and  an  RVM  trace  demonstrating 
disordered  breathing  characteristics  might  have  led  to  the  utilization  of  CPAP.  Also, 
decreased MV at the time of discharge might have led clinical personnel to delay transfer to 
the floor or triage the patient to a step-down unit or monitored bed. 

RR  and  pulse  oximetry  are  only  surrogate  indicators  of  ventilatory  drive.  RR,  as  this  case 
illustrates, does not reliably provide an accurate picture of overall ventilation, as it does not 
adequately reflect variations in tidal volume. Pulse oximetry has well-documented issues with 
reliability and false alarms in the clinical setting and represents at best only the end result of 
respiration [12-14]. As a result, there can be a substantial delay between onset of respiratory 
compromise and a detectable decline in oxygen saturation levels [12,13]. 

By comparison, the RVM’s reliable, continuous tracking of MV allows direct assessment of 
ventilatory drive in real time. Health care providers can quantify ventilation status on arrival 
to  the  PACU,  recognize  apnea,  evaluate  reductions  in  ventilation  after  opioid  dosing,  and 
prevent  persistent  respiratory  compromise  over  the  course  of  a  PACU  stay.  The  increased 
awareness  afforded  by  the  RVM  facilitates  the  initiation  of  more  timely  interventions. 
Clinical  personnel  can  modify  opioid  regimens,  pursue  alternative  pain  management 
strategies, or initiate CPAP or bilevel positive airway pressure. The RVM data also provide a 
valuable  context  for  discharge  and  triage  decisions,  helping  clinical  personnel  to  avoid 
premature  transfer  and  to  select  an  appropriate  acuity  level  for  subsequent  care. 
Individualization  of  the  pain  management  regimen  in  the  PACU  and  the  ability  to  relay 
quantitative  measurements  upon  transfer  to  the  floor  has  the  potential  to  enhance  patient 
safety. 

RVM  technology  may  also  have  applications  in  pre-operative  screening.  Caregivers  may 
have elected to manage the patient described in this report differently had they been able to 
identify and quantify the apnea exhibited prior to surgery. As discussed earlier, OSA presents 
a  number  of  challenges  to  peri-operative  care.  The  prevalence  of  OSA  and  its  association 
with  post-operative  complications  has  led  the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists  and 
similar organizations to release guidelines calling for prolonged post-surgical observation of 
patients with OSA [15]. Hospitals are left with a management dilemma. Ignoring OSA may 
pose a threat to patient safety and lead to the involvement of costly higher acuity services, but 
generalized  management  programs  can  be  cost-prohibitive  as  well  and  are  potentially 
inefficient  solutions.  Non-invasive,  real-time,  continuous  respiratory  volume  monitoring 
allows  for  direct,  comprehensive  assessment  of  individual  ventilation  during  peri-operative 
care. This technology can contribute to continuing improvement of patient-specific protocols 

for  the  management  of  OSA,  OIRD  and  other  phenomena  that  pose  a  threat  to  respiratory 
competence in the aftermath of surgery.
