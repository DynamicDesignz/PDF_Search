Pre-emptive steroids for a severe oedematous
Buruli ulcer lesion: a case report

Abstract

Introduction: Severe oedematous forms of Buruli ulcer (BU) often result in extensive tissue destruction, even with
the institution of appropriate antibiotic treatment, leading to reconstructive surgery and long-term disability. We
report a case of a patient with severe oedematous BU, which describes for the first time the pre-emptive use of
prednisolone therapy commenced at the time of antibiotic initiation aimed at limiting the ongoing tissue
destruction and its secondary sequelae.
Case presentation: A 91-year-old Australian-born Caucasian woman presented with a WHO category 3 oedematous
BU lesion on the anterior aspect of her right ankle that she had first noticed three weeks earlier. Treatment was
commenced with an antibiotic combination of rifampicin and ciprofloxacin. At the same time, pre-emptive prednisolone
was commenced (a dose of 0.5mg/kg daily). Treatment resulted in rapid and significant reduction in the size of the
induration associated with the lesion, and no significant increase in the size of the skin ulceration. Antibiotics were
continued for 56 days and prednisolone therapy ceased 130 days after antibiotics commenced. No surgery was required.
The wound healed completely after 10 months and there was no long-term limitation of movement at the ankle joint.
Conclusions: Pre-emptive corticosteroid therapy may prevent further progressive tissue necrosis and the need for
secondary reconstructive surgery that commonly occurs during the antibiotic treatment of severe odematous forms of BU.

Introduction
Mycobacterium ulcerans causes destructive lesions of skin
and subcutaneous tissue known as Buruli ulcers (BU).
They are found in 33 countries worldwide but most com-
monly in west and central Africa and south-eastern
Australia. Oedematous cases are the most severe form of
disease, and often result in extensive tissue destruction
leading to reconstructive surgery and long-term disability
[1,2]. Combination antimicrobial therapy is now recom-
mended as first-line treatment of BU [3,4] and results in
high cure rates, limiting the requirements for surgery [5,6].
However, with oedematous lesions ongoing tissue destruc-
tion and increasing ulceration generally occurs despite the
administration of appropriate antibiotics and limits the suc-
cess of early antibiotics [1,7].

We report a case of a patient with severe oedematous
BU and describe for the first time the pre-emptive use of
prednisolone therapy commenced with the initiation of
antibiotic treatment that appeared to limit ongoing tissue
destruction and of the need for reconstructive surgery.

Case presentation
A 91-year-old previously healthy Australian-born Caucasian
woman living in a BU endemic area in Victoria, Australia,
presented with a three-week history of a painful lesion on
the anterior aspect of her right ankle. On examination she
had an indurated, oedematous lesion of 210 × 120mm in
diameter with central necrosis of 20 × 10mm diameter, clas-
sified as a WHO category 3 lesion (Figure 1). She weighed
52kgs, and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ap-
proximately 60mLs/minute. A diagnosis of an oedematous
BU lesion was made based on the clinical appearance of
the lesion and a positive M. ulcerans PCR of a swab of
the lesion.

Figure 1 Severe oedematous Buruli ulcer lesion before antibiotic and prednisolone treatment. This figure shows the odematous Buruli ulcer lesion of the
right ankle prior to treatment. There is a central area of developing necrosis anterior to the ankle joint, with a total area of induration associated with the
lesion of 25.2cm2 (21cm diameter in a horizontal pane and 12cm diameter in a vertical plane). The black pen lines on the skin mark the edges of the
induration in a vertical plane.

She was commenced on rifampicin 450mg daily and
ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily. As we were concerned
she was at risk of further tissue necrosis, pre-emptive pred-
nisolone of 30mg daily (0.5mg/kg/day) was initiated at the
same time.

After three days the induration associated with the le-
sion had reduced by 74% to 120 × 55mm in diameter
and the size of the ulceration remained stable (Figure 2,
Table 1). Further reduction in induration had occurred
by day 6 (Figure 3) and after four weeks of prednisolone

in size, but the total area of induration associated with the lesion has reduced by 74% to 6.6cm2 (12cm diameter in a horizontal pane and 5.5cm
diameter in a vertical plane). The black pen lines on the skin show the reduction in size of the induration in the vertical plane.

combined with antibiotics there was no induration asso-
ciated with the lesion and the size of the ulceration
remained stable (Figure 4).

The ciprofloxacin dose was reduced at day 3 to 250 mg
twice daily because of nausea potentially caused by relatively
high systemic ciprofloxacin levels related to her advanced
age and moderately reduced renal function, and after 26
days of antibiotics she developed a rash and the ciprofloxa-
cin was replaced by clarithromycin 250mg twice daily.

Antibiotics were ceased after a total of 56 days. The prednis-
olone was well tolerated and was initially weaned off over 44
days. However, due to a subsequent increase in induration
associated with the lesion, it was recommenced at a low
dose (5mg daily) 83 days after antibiotics commenced, then
weaned off 130 days after antibiotics commenced (Table 1).
No surgical debridement or reconstruction was required.

The lesion healed to a dry scab six months after com-
mencing antibiotics, and had completely healed by 10

Discussion
Oedematous lesions account for about 7% of BU cases
seen in the Bellarine Peninsula, South-Eastern Australia

[1]. Compared to non-oedematous lesions they are more
likely to occur in diabetics and those who have a lesion
on the hand, elbow or ankle [1]. They represent the
most aggressive form of BU with 76% of lesions in our
health service presenting at an advanced stage (WHO
category 2 or 3) due to rapid progression and delays in
diagnosis [1]. As a result, oedematous BU lesions are

often associated with significant tissue necrosis, and this
can progress even after the commencement of appropri-
ate antibiotic treatment [1,7]. Severe lesions usually re-
quire debridement and reconstructive surgery (94% in
our experience) [1], increasing the cost of treatment [8]
and often resulting in long-term disability [9].

Reasons for the ongoing ulceration despite appropriate
antibiotic treatment are not known but may include tissue
swelling and secondary ischaemia of skin and superficial
tissues resulting from paradoxical reactions, analogous to
the paradoxical enlargement and suppuration of tubercu-
lous lymphadenitis on treatment [10]. These commonly
occur during or after the antibiotic treatment of BU le-
sions [5,11], and are more frequent in the treatment of
oedematous forms of the disease [1]. Alternatively, it may
be due to a delayed effect of persisting mycolactone, a po-
tent exotoxin produced by M. ulcerans that is toxic to tis-
sues [12]. We have previously reported successful use of
prednisolone to limit tissue damage in patients experien-
cing severe BU-associated paradoxical reactions without
negative effects on curative outcomes [13,14]. Research
from the mouse model also suggests corticosteroids could
potentially be utilised in the treatment of paradoxical reac-
tions without reducing the effectiveness of antibiotic treat-
ment [15]. Therefore,
if paradoxical reactions are the
cause of ongoing tissue loss in oedematous BU lesions on
antibiotic treatment, we have previously postulated that
pre-emptive prednisolone may prevent it [1].

In this case, at the time of commencing antibiotic treat-
ment, we started pre-emptive prednisolone at the dose rec-
ommended for treatment of BU-associated paradoxical
reactions [3]. The aim was to try and minimize the progres-
sion of tissue necrosis, the need for reconstructive surgery
and long-term potential complications such as limitation of
movement of the ankle joint, which would likely have oc-
curred in the absence of pre-emptive treatment.

We postulate that the pre-emptive prednisolone treat-
ment was effective in achieving these aims with no pro-
gression of
the ulceration on treatment, a rapid
reduction in the size of the associated induration, the
avoidance of surgery and the lesion healing completely
with no long-term sequelae such as limitation of move-
ment at the ankle joint. Prednisolone was well tolerated
in this patient. However, it can have potential adverse
effects that need to be considered before use such as the
potential
infections including
hepatitis B, tuberculosis and strongyloides (of particular
concern in west and central Africa where most BU cases
occur), destabilise diabetes, cause gastrointestinal ulcer-
ation, and progression of osteoporosis. Therefore, we
believe that further study, including prospective trials,
be performed to assess the safety and efficacy of pre-
emptive corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe
oedematous BU.

to worsen co-existent

In this case, we used the initial antibiotic combination ri-
fampicin and ciprofloxacin, which we have found to be
highly effective in curing BU lesions and preventing disease
recurrences [6,16-18]. However, it should be noted that al-
though this combination is one of the recommended first-
line antibiotic regimens for BU treatment by Australian
experts, WHO recommends the use of rifampicin and
streptomycin as the standard antibiotic regimen [4].

Conclusions
Our case suggests that pre-emptive corticosteroid therapy
commenced at the time of antibiotic treatment initiation
may prevent further progressive tissue necrosis and the need
for secondary reconstructive surgery that commonly occurs
during the antibiotic treatment of severe oedematous forms
of BU.
