Abstract 

Introduction 

Desmoid  tumor  is  a  rare,  benign,  usually  asymptomatic  fibromatous  lesion.  The  etiology  is 
unknown  and  the  diagnosis  is  based  on  histopathological  examination.  The  treatment  is 
complete resection of the tumor. Pancreatic desmoid tumor is extremely rare. In the literature 
there  have  been  only  11  cases  described,  most  of  them  as  solid  or  solid-cystic  masses.  We 
report  the  case  of  a  patient  with  an  isolated  cystic  pancreatic  desmoid  tumor  that  is,  to  the 
best of our knowledge, the second reported case. 

Case presentation 

A  13-year  old  Caucasian  boy  presented  with  recurrent  pain  of  two  months’  duration  in  the 
left  hypochondrium of his  abdomen. An ultrasound examination and computed tomography 
scan revealed the presence of a cystic mass  located in  his  splenic hilum,  tightly  adjacent  to 
the  pancreatic  tail.  A  splenic  cyst  was  suspected.  Operative  findings  showed  a  10x10cm 
cystic  mass  tightly  connected  to  the  pancreatic  tail  and  left  colonic  flexure,  adherent  to  the 
spleen, splenic vein and artery. Distal splenopancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the left 
colonic  flexure  was  performed.  Histological  analysis  confirmed  that  the  resection  was 
complete. The mass had infiltrated the pancreatic parenchyma. All tumor cells were positive 
for anti-beta-catenin staining characteristic for desmoid tumor. No abnormalities in the spleen 
and colon were found. 

Conclusions 

Isolated  sporadic  pancreatic  desmoid  tumor  with  cyst  formation  is  extremely  rare  and  its 
diagnosis can be difficult,  especially because of  uncharacteristic symptoms  and radiological 
findings, as in our patient. This case report should be of interest not only to surgeons, as the 
treatment of choice is radical resection, but also gastroenterologists, considering it is in close 
relation with familial adenomatous polyposis, and oncologists as the reason for differentiation 
with other pancreatic tumors.

Introduction 

Desmoid tumor (DT) is a particular type of fibromatosis. It is a rare fibromatous lesion that is 
a  result  of  abnormal  proliferation  of  myofibroblasts.  DT  generally  involves  fascial  and 
musculoaponeurotic  tissues.  It  comprises  0.03%  of  all  tumors  and  3%  of  fibrous  tissue 
tumors [1,2]. We can distinguish DT of abdominal or pelvic wall - 49%, extra-abdominal DT 
(shoulder girdle, chest and inguinal region) - 43% and intra-abdominal DT (retroperitoneum 
and  mesentery)  -  8%  [3].  Intra-abdominal  DTs  are  often  observed  in  familial  adenomatous 
polyposis (FAP) - concerning about 30% of these patients [4,5]. Desmoid tumors are benign, 
do  not  metastasize,  but  their  advancement  can  be  life-threatening  due  to  aggressive  local 
invasion. DTs usually are asymptomatic for a long period of time before the diagnosis. The 
etiology  remains  unclear.  Attention  is  paid  to  the  role  of  injury  (postoperative  scars), 
hormonal  (estrogen  -  higher  incidence  of  DT  in  women  during  their  reproductive  years, 
pregnancy, disappearance after menopause, regression under the influence of tamoxifen) and 
genetic factors (elements of FAP or Gardner’s syndrome - APC gene mutation) [1,3,6]. The 
diagnosis  is  based  on  histopathological  examination  that  shows  fibroblastic  proliferation 
confirmed  with  positive  beta-catenin  immunohistochemical  staining.  There  is  no  clear 
statement  concerning  the  treatment.  The  most  effective  method  seems  to  be  complete 
resection but considering the high tendency of recurrence, complementary treatment such as 
tamoxifen, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy still constitutes a research subject [1]. 

Isolated  pancreatic  DT  is  extremely  rare.  In  the  literature  there  have  been  only  11  cases 
described  of  pancreatic  DT  with  eight  located  in  the  tail.  Seven  out  of  11  published  cases 
were solid mass, with only three solid-cystic and one cystic mass [3,4,6,7]. 

We  report  the  case  of  a  patient  with  an  isolated  cystic  mass  located  in  the  pancreatic  tail 
diagnosed  by  beta-catenin  immunohistochemical  staining  as  a  DT;  it  is,  to  the  best  of  our 
knowledge, the second reported case. 

Case presentation 

A  13-year-old  Caucasian  boy  presented  to  our  department  with  recurrent  pain  in  the  left 
hypochondrium  of  his  abdomen  of  two  months’  duration.  Laboratory  tests  showed  no 
abnormalities. An ultrasound examination and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the 
presence  of  a  cystic  mass  (10x7x9cm)  with  multiple  septums  located  in  his  splenic  hilum, 
tightly  adjacent  to  the  pancreatic  tail  and  the  left  kidney  (Figure  1).  A  splenic  cyst  was 
suspected. Test results for Echinococcus antibodies were negative. Our patient was qualified 
for radical surgery. Before the operation, the patient was vaccinated with pneumococcal and 
meningococcal  vaccines  as  recommended  in  cases  of  elective  splenectomy.  Operative 
findings showed a 10x10cm cystic mass with a thick, grey white wall, tightly connected and 
macroscopically invading his pancreatic tail and left colonic flexure, spleen, splenic vein and 
artery, but  not  his  stomach and left  kidney (Figure 2). Distal  splenopancreatectomy with  en 
bloc  resection  of  the  left  colonic  flexure  was  performed  as  a  guarantee  of  radical  tumor 
excision. The macroscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed cyst with a thick wall 
and multiple septums, filled with white fluid (Figure 3). Histological analysis confirmed that 
the  resection  was  complete.  The  mass  had  infiltrated  the  pancreatic  parenchyma  and 
consisted of fibroblastic cells with a regular nucleus with low mitotic activity, with abundant 
extracellular  collagen  matrix.  The  pancreatic  tail  ducts  were  dilated  with  nonspecific 
inflammation and calcification in its wall. All tumor cells were positive for anti-beta-catenin 
staining (Figure 4). No abnormalities or DT cells were found in the spleen and colon.

Postoperative  course  was  complicated  by  pancreatic  leakage  successfully  treated  with 
endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatography  with  Wirsung’s  duct  stenting.  Because  of 
the  complete  resection  and  sporadic  origin  of  the  tumor,  no  corresponding  treatment  was 
given.  Bearing  in  mind  that  intra-abdominal  DTs  are  commonly  connected  with  FAP,  our 
patient underwent colonoscopy, which revealed no changes in the colon wall. 

After  19  months  of  follow-up,  the  clinical  examination  and  ultrasonography  (USG)  are 
normal and show no recurrence of the DT. 

Discussion 

Desmoid  tumor  is  a  very  rare  fibromatous  lesion,  a  result  of  abnormal  myofibroblast 
proliferation. DTs are benign, do not metastasize but can be locally aggressive. Localization 
of DTs can be abdominal or pelvic, extra-abdominal or intra-abdominal. Intra-abdominal DTs 
are  the  rarest  and  mostly  associated  with  FAP.  Pancreatic  DTs,  as  described  in  our  patient, 
are extremely rare, are mostly located in the tail of the pancreas, and occur as a solid mass. 
To the best of our knowledge, only three cases from those already reported were with a cystic 
component  and  only  one  case  occurred  as  a  cyst  like  in  our  patient.  DTs  are  usually 
asymptomatic for a long period of time or can cause uncharacteristic pain as observed in our 
case.  An  initial  diagnosis  of  DT  based  on  radiological  findings  and  laboratory  tests  is 
impossible.  It  requires  differentiation  from  other  abdominal  cystic  tumors.  The  final 
diagnosis  can  be  based  only  on  histological  and  immunohistochemical  findings  [8].  In  our 
case, our patient was qualified for surgery while splenic cyst was suspected. The diagnosis of 
DT was unexpected and confirmed by positive nuclear immunostaining of beta-catenin. The 
treatment  of  choice  for  DT  seems  to  be  a  complete  resection  with  clear  margins.  However, 
many  reports  suggest,  with  benign  tumors  such  as  DT,  complementary  treatment  with 
tamoxifen,  chemo-  or  radiotherapy  [1].  Also  successful  treatment  with  nonsteroidal  anti-
inflammatory drugs has been reported [9]. In our case, distal  splenopancreatectomy  with  en 
bloc  resection  of  the  left  colonic  flexure  with  histopathologically  confirmed  uninvolved 
margins  was  the  reason  for  no  complementary  therapy.  Our  patient  remains  disease-free  19 
months after the surgery. Taking into account the close relationship between DTs and FAP, 
investigations  for  colonic  changes  should  be  undertaken.  In  our  case,  colonoscopy  revealed 
no changes in the colonic wall. 

Conclusions 

Isolated  sporadic  pancreatic  desmoid  tumor  with  cyst  formation  is  extremely  rare  and  its 
diagnosis can be difficult, such as in our case, where it preoperatively presented as a splenic 
cyst. Even though DTs are benign and do not metastasize, they can be locally aggressive. It is 
considered that when possible, the treatment of choice for DT is radical resection with clear 
margins, as in our patient.
