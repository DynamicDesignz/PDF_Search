Abstract 
Introduction 

Moyamoya  disease  is  characterized  by  progressive  steno-occlusive  changes  of  the  distal 
internal  carotid  and  developed  collateral  vasculature,  so  called  ‘moyamoya’  vessels  at  the 
base of the brain. Variant angina is a rare occurrence in patients with moyamoya disease. 

Case presentation 

Here  we  report  the  case  of  a  41-year-old  Korean  woman  who  developed  chest  pain  after 
indirect  revascularization  surgery  of  moyamoya  disease.  A  treadmill  test  and  an  exercise 
stress echocardiograph showed positive results, but there was no significant major coronary 
arteries  stenosis.  Suspicious of  vasospasm, we  conducted  an  ergonovine spasm stimulation 
test, which demonstrated tight stenosis of her proximal left anterior descending artery. At the 
site of spasm, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology showed intraluminal fibrous plaque. 

Conclusion 

Physicians who follow up patients with  moyamoya disease would need to be aware of the 
possibility of cardiac ischemia as well as neurological manifestations.

Introduction 
Moyamoya disease is an uncommon condition characterized by spontaneous bilateral stenosis 
or occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and other proximal portions 
of cerebral arteries accompanied by collateral branches which on angiography seem hazy like 
a  puff  of  cigarette  smoke  [1].  Although  the  etiology  of  moyamoya  disease  is  unknown, 
reduced  vasoreactivity  of  cerebral  vessels  has  been  reported  in  moyamoya  disease  [2]. 
Autopsies  have  revealed  decreased  vessel  size  with  fibrous  thickening  of  the  intima  with 
minimum 
lamina  degeneration  and  no  substantial 
inflammatory cell infiltration is seen in the vascular wall [3]. There have been several reports 
of involvement of extracranial vessels, especially the renal arteries, in moyamoya disease [4] 
but few studies have provided evidence as to whether these patients developed ischemic heart 
disease [5,6]. Here we report the first case of variant angina pectoris proven by ergonovine 
provocation test associated with moyamoya disease. 
Case presentation 
A 41-year-old Korean woman was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of recurrent 
chest pain in February 2014. The pain felt like squeezing of her chest, which radiated to her 
left  arm,  occurred  usually  in  the  morning  or  when  it  was  getting  cold,  was  aggravated  by 
stress  and  relieved  by  sublingual  nitroglycerin  spray.  She  was  diagnosed  with  moyamoya 
disease 8 years ago in 2006 and received indirect revascularization, encephalo-duro-arterio-
synangiosis  (Figure  1A  and  B),  she  has  had  chest  pain  since  then.  One  month  later,  she 
underwent  a  cardiology  work  up  including  exercise  stress  echocardiography  and  coronary 
angiography  (CAG)  at  another  hospital.  Exercise  stress  echocardiography  showed  left 
anterior  descending  artery  (LAD)  territory  ischemia  but  the  CAG  showed  no  significant 
coronary  artery  stenosis.  She  was  diagnosed  with  syndrome  X  and  then  referred  to  a 
psychiatrist at that time. She had never smoked cigarettes, she was not a social drinker and 
she  denied  a  family  history  of  cardiovascular  disease.  She  has  complained  of  intermittent 
chest pain and the intensity of it increased before she visited our hospital.

(arrows). A: Magnetic resonance angiography, coronal view; B: axial view. 

The results of laboratory tests including creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, and troponin T 
were within normal levels and electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with no ST-segment 
abnormality.  Echocardiography  showed  normal  LV  function  and  no  regional  wall  motion 
abnormality.  A  treadmill  test  showed  positive  result  of  ST-segment  depression  and  chest 
discomfort at stage 4. Coronary computed tomography angiography and CAG (Figure 2A and 
B), showed a hypoplastic right coronary artery without significant coronary artery stenosis. 
We  performed  a  coronary  spasm  provocation  test,  suspicious  of  vasospastic  angina. 
Ergonovine 0.2mg was injected three times intravenously at 5-minute intervals. We achieved 
cine  angiogram  at  90  seconds  after  each  ergonovine  injection.  Coronary  angiography 
demonstrated  proximal  LAD  focal  95%  stenosis  after  two  administrations  of  intravenous 

ergonovine; the patient complained of typical chest pain and there were ST-segment changes 
(Figure 3A and B). After injection of intracoronary nitroglycerin, the stenosis was completely 
resolved  and  her  T  wave  was  normalized  (Figure  3C  and  D).  An  intravascular  ultrasound 
virtual  histology  (IVUS-VH)  image  for  the  site  of  the  spasm  showed  fibrous  plaque 
occupying 33% of the coronary luminal area (Figure 4).

Finally  the  patient  was  diagnosed  with  variant  angina  and  we  prescribed  calcium  channel 
blocker,  nitrate  and  moderate  dose  of  statin.  Her  chest  pain  seemed  to  be  controlled  with 
those  medications;  however,  her  chest  pain  recurred  several  months  later.  We  added 
nicorandil  and  non-dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blocker;  we  are  monitoring  her  every 
month at our out-patient clinic and up to now there have been no further events. 
Discussion 

The incidence of moyamoya disease is higher in East Asia, such as Japan and Korea, than in 
Western countries. Moyamoya disease is generally manifested by ischemic or hemorrhagic 
stroke (that is, hemiplegia, headache, numbness, and so on) and occasionally accompanied by 
extracerebral disease (autoimmune disease, connective tissue disease and extracranial arterial 
system)  [7].  Although  an  association  of  moyamoya  and  renovascular  disease  is  well 
described [4], reports of coronary artery disease in moyamoya disease are rare. To the best of 
our  knowledge  only  four  cases  of  moyamoya  disease  with  suspicious  variant  angina  have 
been reported, but no studies have provided evidence as to variant angina proven vasospasm 
and shown virtual histology of coronary artery as in this patient [6,8]. 

Spontaneous occlusion of cerebrovascular moyamoya disease is characterized by occlusive or 
stenotic lesions at or around the terminal portions of the internal carotid arteries and abnormal 
vascular  networks  at  the  base  of  the  brain.  The  obstructive  lesions  are  caused  by  fibrous 
thickening  of the intima  with  minimum  lipid  deposition,  the  internal  elastic lamina  is well 
preserved, and no substantial inflammatory cell infiltration is seen in the vascular wall. 

Many  reports  showed  that  the  pulmonary,  renal  and  pancreatic  arteries  in  patients  with 
moyamoya disease may manifest histopathologic changes similar to the stenotic changes of 
the intracranial internal carotid arteries [9,10]. Even though a few cases of coronary artery 
stenosis in patients with moyamoya disease have been reported, the histopathology of these 
coronary lesions is similar to the findings of the carotid arteries of patients with moyamoya. 

Pathology  has  shown  soft  intimal  proliferation  with  minimum  lipid  deposition  which 
significantly differs from typical atherosclerotic plaques. Usual coronary artery spasm very 
often occurs at the site of atheromatous plaques, which suggests that atheromatous plaques 
could magnify the lumen diameter reduction. In this case we showed coronary artery spasm 
within the site of fibrous plaque in a patient with moyamoya disease. An IVUS-VH finding of 
CAD  in  moyamoya  disease  reported  by  Lee  et  al.  showed  intracoronary  fibrous  plaque 
similar to our case [11]. The cellular proliferation and vascular dysregulation in moyamoya 
and vascular smooth muscle cell hyperreactivity in variant angina were suggested to have a 
common pathogenic link. This finding indicates that moyamoya disease may actually be an 
intracranial manifestation in a systemic arterial disorder. 

Another possible link between these disorders is genetic and ethnic factors. The pathogenesis 
of  moyamoya  disease  is  still unclear. Many reports  suggest  that genetic  factors  might  also 
contribute to the development of the disease; data from an epidemiological study showed a 
high incidence among the Japanese and Asian population, together with a familial occurrence 
in approximately 10 to 15% of cases, which strongly suggests a genetic etiology. An analysis 
of an American survey of 298 patients with moyamoya disease found an annual prevalence of 
0.086  per  100,000  which  was  significantly  lower  than  the  0.35  reported  in  a  nationwide 
Japanese survey [12,13]. Similarly, an analysis of the epidemiological features of this disease 
in Hawaii, where a high proportion of the population are Asian and Pacific Islanders (56%), 
found incidence and prevalence of moyamoya disease to be higher than in the rest of the USA 
because of the larger percentage of people of Asian ethnic origins [14]. The role of genetic 
factors in the pathogenesis of variant angina has also been suggested by the observation of a 
different  prevalence  of  vasospastic  angina  in  Japanese  and  White  people.  In  the  USA,  the 
frequency  is  about  4%  of  patients  who  underwent  coronary  angiography  with  positive 
ergonovine  test,  whereas  in  Japan,  positive  study  rates  are  in  the  rage  of  30%  [15,16]. 
Japanese patients are much more likely to develop coronary artery vasospasm than Caucasian 
patients. 

Both  Moyamoya  disease  and  variant  angina  are  more  frequent  in  Asian  populations, 
including  Japanese,  than  in  Caucasian  populations.  Although  a  specific  associative 
mechanism between both diseases is not clear, a racial or a genetic characteristic might be 
related to the pathogenesis. Further epidemiologic and genetic data are needed to elucidate 
the correlated mechanism of these diseases. 

From the clinical point of view, it is important to cure the ischemic attack of patients who 
have both moyamoya and variant angina. This case suggests that moyamoya disease might be 
regarded as a systemic vascular disorder, and evaluation of the extracerebral cardiovascular 
system is also required in this disease. 
Conclusions 
The  etiology  of  moyamoya  disease  is  still  unknown,  but  the  disease  can  be  regarded  as  a 
systemic arterial disease. Physicians who follow up patients with moyamoya disease need to 
be  aware  of the possibility of cardiac  ischemia  as  well  as neurological  manifestations. We 
believe that educating patients about cardiac symptoms is also important so that these patients 
will seek medical attention if cardiac symptoms manifest.
