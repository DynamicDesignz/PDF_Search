Abstract 

Introduction 

Epithelioid  hemangioendothelioma  (EHE)  is  a  rare  endothelial  tumor  with  an  intermediate 
grade  of  malignancy.  Few  cases  of  primary  vascular  hemangioendothelioma  have  been 
described  in  the  literature.  Surgery  is  the  treatment  of  choice,  but  radiation  therapy  and 
chemotherapy should also be considered in particular cases. 

Case presentation 

We present the case of a 44-year-old Caucasian woman affected by EHE of the cephalic vein, 
treated  by  complete  surgical  removal  of  the  mass  and  postoperative  local  radiation  therapy. 
At 5-year follow-up, our patient is alive, with no signs of local or distant relapse and with no 
late radiation-related effects. 

Conclusions 

Postoperative  radiotherapy  may  play  a  role  in  cases  in  which  tumor  margins  are  close  or 
cannot be assessed or when high-risk features are present.

Introduction 

Epithelioid  hemangioendothelioma  (EHE)  is  a  rare  type  of  endothelial  tumor  that 
demonstrates  an  intermediate  behavior  between  benign  hemangioma  and  malignant 
angiosarcoma.  It  can  occur  in  soft  tissues,  bones  and  visceral  organs  but  also  as  a  primary 
tumor of the blood vessel. About half of EHE are primary vascular. Differential diagnosis is 
often  difficult,  but  recent  diagnostic  tools  such  as  immunohistochemistry  and  mutation 
research  can  be  useful  for  correct  characterization.  Surgery  is  the  treatment  of  choice,  but 
adjuvant  treatment  such  as  radiation  therapy  should  be  considered  in  the  case  of  high-risk 
features  or  when  complete  removal  is  not  feasible.  Although  sometimes  promising, 
chemotherapy and antiangiogenetic agents do not have a well-established role. We report the 
case of intravascular EHE occurring in the cephalic vein of a 44-year-old woman, treated by 
surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (RT). 

Case presentation 

A 44-year-old  Caucasian woman presented with  a soft, painless,  nonpulsatile, progressively 
enlarging mass at the level of the antecubital fossa of the left arm. A preliminary ultrasound 
(US)  scan  revealed  an  hypoechoic  solid  lesion  along  the  cephalic  vein,  and  a  subsequent 
magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the arm confirmed a 2×1cm mass with a hypointense T1 
signal  and  a  weakly  hyperintense  T2  signal  along  the  vein,  suggesting  a  granuloma  (Figure 
1). Upon physical examination, the mass was mobile and painless; our patient did not present 
modification of reflexes of her left arm or signs of venous stasis. Our patient then underwent 
surgical  removal  of  the  neoplasm.  Histology  confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  intravenous  EHE, 
defined  as  a  ‘low-grade  malignancy  with  moderate  potential  to  recur  locally  or  to 
metastatize’.  Unfortunately,  surgical  margins  were  microscopically  involved,  so  our  patient 
underwent  a  second  surgical  operation:  a  2cm  segment  of  cephalic  vein  with  a  lozenge  of 
skin  was  excised  and  replaced  with  a  graft.  The  definitive  histopathologic  report  confirmed 
the presence of microscopic residual foci of EHE, with free surgical margins. Our patient did 
not show any surgery-related impairment of her left arm functions. A post-surgery US study 
and  MRI  scan  did  not  show  any  residual  mass,  while  a  total-body  positron  emission 
tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) did not show any metastatic disease to regional 
lymph nodes or distant sites. Our patient was then referred to our radiation oncology unit. In 
consideration  of  the  presence  of  microscopic  disease  foci  in  the  second  operation  specimen 
and  the  considerable  potential  of  local  relapse  highlighted  by  the  pathologist,  our  patient 
underwent  RT  4  months  after  the  last  surgery.  A  total  dose  of  54Gy  in  27  fractions  was 
administered with a single 6×6cm field. An 8MeV electron beam was used. Only a mild acute 
erythema of the irradiated skin was recorded as acute toxicity. During follow-up, our patient 
underwent  MRI  or  ultrasound  scans  of  the  left  arm  every  6  months  and  computed 
tomography  (CT)  of  the  thorax  and  hepatic  ultrasound  scans  every  year.  Five  years  after 
completion of the RT, our patient is alive with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. 
She  presented  a  Radiation  Therapy  Oncology  Group  (RTOG)  grade  1  late  toxicity  in  the 
irradiated skin (pigmentation changes).

Discussion 

Hemangioendothelioma  (HE)  is  a  vascular  neoplasm  that  shows  intermediate  biological 
behavior  between  benign  hemangiomas  and  highly  malignant  angiosarcomas.  It  has  the 
potential to metastatize or recur, although less frequently than classic angiosarcoma. 

In  the  most  recent  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  Classification  [1]  of  soft  tissue 
sarcoma, HE is included in the group of vascular tumors of the soft tissues and of the bones. 
Five  subtypes  of  HE  of  soft  tissues  are  considered:  Kaposiform  HE  (included  in  the 
intermediate-locally aggressive group), retiform HE, composite HE and pseudomyogenic HE 
(included in  the intermediate-rarely metastasizing  group)  and epithelioid  HE, classified as a 
malignant tumor. 

Pseudomyogenic  (epithelioid  sarcoma-like)  HE  was  the  first  subgroup  introduced  in  this 
classification.  It  usually  occurs  in  young  adult  men  on  the  limbs,  presenting  with  multiple 
nodules. The spindle cells are characterized by a t(7;19) translocation [2]. 

Kaposiform HE is a locally aggressive neoplasm that involves superficial or deep soft tissues 
of children and teenagers; it has features common to both capillary hemangioma and Kaposi 
sarcoma,  with  several  solid  poorly  circumscribed  nodules  composed  of  a  mixture  of  small 
capillaries  and  solid  lobules  of  endothelial  cells  arranged  in  a  glomeruloid  pattern  [3].  It  is 
often  associated  with  consumptive  coagulopathy  (Kasabach-Merritt  syndrome)  and 
lymphangiomatosis [4]. 

Retiform HE most often occurs in the extremities of young adults as a slowly growing single 
cutaneous  plaque  or  subcutaneous  nodule  microscopically  characterized  by  interconnecting 
arborizing blood vessels arranged in a net-like pattern and minimal cytologic atypia [5]. It has 
a high frequency of local recurrence but a low metastatic potential [6]. 

The  term  ‘composite  HE’  indicates  a  locally  aggressive  vascular  neoplasm  of  low-grade 
malignancy  showing  varying  combinations  of  benign,  low-grade  malignant,  and  high-grade 
malignant vascular components [7]. 

Epithelioid  hemangioendothelioma  (EHE)  is  probably  the  most  aggressive  histological 
subtype. It originates from the endothelium and most often occurs in adults of both sexes, but 
may  rarely  also  affect  children  [8].  It  was  first  described  by  Weiss  and  Enziger  [9],  after  a 
review  of  14  patients,  as  an  intermediate  entity  between  a  benign  hemangioma  and  a  high-
grade angiosarcoma. The largest series of 137 cases of liver EHE was reported by Makhlouf 
et al. [10]. 

Histopathological  evaluation  is  central  to  the  diagnosis  of  this  tumor.  Biopsy  and 
immunohistochemical  assays  are  essential  to  establish  a  clear  diagnosis  and  to  distinguish 
EHE  from  other  histological  types  such  as  carcinoma,  infectious  processes,  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma such as renal cell carcinoma, Ewing’s sarcoma, telangiectatic osteosarcoma, 
lymphoma 
epithelioid 
hemangioendothelioma,  and  angiosarcoma  [11,12].  Corrin  et  al.  first  identified  the 

or  multiple  myeloma 

(plasmatocytoma), 

hemangioma, 

angiogenic  nature  of  these  tumors  based  on  the  identification  of  Weibel-Palade  bodies  in  a 
kind of lung neoplasia previously called ‘intravascular bronchioloalveolar tumor’ [13]. 

Microscopically,  EHE  produces  a  typical  dense  myxochondroid  or  myxohyaline  matrix  in 
which  endothelial  cells  are  embedded,  arranged  in  short  strings  or  nests  [14].  Endothelial 
cells are polygonal, round or occasionally fusiform. Usually, mitotic activity is infrequent and 
nuclei are uniform, but about one-third of EHE could present anaplastic features with a high 
nuclear  grade,  necrosis  and  high  mitotic  activity.  Due  to  its  variable  histological  features, 
differential  diagnosis can be difficult.  Immunohistochemistry is  a useful  tool:  EHE shows a 
typical  endothelial  phenotype,  characterized  by  positivity  to  CD31,  CD34  and  von 
Willebrand  factor,  and  occasionally  to  cytokeratins  [15].  Recently,  some  studies  have 
proposed  new  markers  for  vascular  differentiation.  For  example,  nuclear  Fli-1,  a  protein 
expressed in endothelial cells as well as in T cells and megakaryocytes, was detected in 100% 
of  cases  in  a  series  of  13  EHE  and  demonstrated  a  better  sensitivity  than  CD34  and  better 
specificity  than  CD31  [16].  Podoplanin,  a  transmembrane  mucoprotein  expressed  in 
lymphatic endothelium, alveolar type I cells, osteoblasts and peritoneal mesothelial cells but 
not  in  normal  vascular  endothelial  cells,  is  a  useful  marker  to  distinguish  EHE  from 
nonvascular  tumors  [17,18].  FKBP12,  which  inhibits  Ca2+  and  calmodulin-dependent 
calcineurin  function,  regulates  B  and  T  cell  responses,  and  is  expressed  in  both  low-  and 
high-grade  vascular  tumors,  is  expressed  in  well-differentiated  areas  of  EHE  [19].  An 
immunohistochemical panel [20] including FKBP12 combined with CD34 and CD31 allows 
a 93% diagnostic sensitivity of hemangioendothelioma. 

A  recurrent  translocation  t(1;3)(p36.23;q25.1),  resulting  in  the  fusion  of  CAMTA1  on 
1p36.23 to WWTR1 on 3q25.1, has recently been identified in most EHE, even if in different 
sites  and  grades  of  malignancy  [21,22];  this  translocation  has  not  been  detected  in  other 
pathologies  like  epithelioid  hemangioma,  epithelioid  angiosarcoma  or  pseudomyogenic 
(epithelioid  sarcoma-like)  HE,  which  often  mimic  EHE  and  make  diagnosis  more  difficult. 
Another recurrent oncogenic activation secondary to TFE3 gene rearrangements and common 
fusion with YAP1 appears to be a distinctive subset of EHE occurring in young adults, with a 
clinically  indolent  course  but  a  high  propensity  to  metastasis  [23].  Fluorescent  in  situ 
hybridization  (FISH)  or  RT-PCR  analysis  for  these  fusions  may  be  a  useful  molecular 
diagnostic tool in challenging diagnoses. 

The  etiology  of  EHE  is  not  well  known;  however,  predisposing  factors  for  angiosarcoma 
have  been  suggested  to  include  radiation,  defunctionalized  arteriovenous  fistula,  foreign 
bodies, carotid endarterectomy and intravascular prosthesis [24]. 

After a  review of 30 patients with  epithelioid  EHE, Mentzel  et  al. found that, although this 
tumor histologically has low malignancy potential, metastatic disease occurs in 20 to 30% of 
patients and that overall EHE carries a risk of death of up to 17%; thus, the authors suggested 
that it should be considered a fully malignant, rather than borderline, vascular neoplasm [25]. 
Local recurrence occurs in about 10 to 15% of osseous EHE cases [12] after a relatively long 
period of latency. Half of the metastases occur in locoregional lymph nodes or lungs [26], so 
periodic  CT  scans  of  regional  lymph  nodes  and  lungs  are  recommended  in  the  follow-up. 
However, patients with metastases could be treated with surgery and then survive for a long 
time:  only  20%  of  them  die  due  to  the  disease  after  5  years  [27]  although  half  of  all 
metastases are in the regional lymph nodes and could be easily controlled with local surgical 
excision [28]. Prognosis of EHE remains better than that of classic angiosarcoma, although it 
often remains variable and unpredictable. 

Deyrup et al. analyzed 49 patients with EHE in an attempt to identify a method for stratifying 
risk of mortality. In univariate and multivariate analysis, increasing mitotic activity and size 
were  significantly  associated  with  higher  mortality,  while  tumor  site,  cytologic  atypia,  the 
presence  of  necrosis  and  tumor  spindling  were  not  significant.  The  authors  concluded  that 
large tumors (>3cm) with high mitotic activity (>3 mitotic figures per 50 high power fields) 
had the worst prognosis with a 5-year disease-specific survival of 59% and an increased risk 
of metastases (up to 25%) [8]. 

Clinical  presentation  is  variable,  depending  on  the  size  and  location  of  the  tumor.  EHE  is 
often  asymptomatic,  especially  when  it  involves  visceral  organs  such  as  the  lungs  or  liver. 
Nonspecific correlated symptoms can include fatigue, anorexia, nausea, or poor tolerance to 
exercise [29]. When a superficial vessel is involved, EHE can present as a painful soft mass. 

Radiological  assessment  is  the  first  approach  to  identifying  EHE.  The  imaging  technique 
used  (MRI,  CT,  US)  depends  on  the  primary  site  of  the  tumor.  Increased  uptake  of  18-F-
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in this tumor has recently been reported [30]. 

EHE can affect all vascularized tissues in any site, but most frequently involves superficial or 
deep  soft  tissues,  bones  [31,32]  and  visceral  organs,  in  particular  the  liver  [33]  and  lungs 
[34,35]. Cases of EHE have been described in almost all sites such as the skin [36,37], central 
nervous  system  [38-40],  meninges  [41],  lips  [42],  gingiva  [43,44],  middle  ear  [45],  thyroid 
gland [46], salivary glands [47], paranasal sinuses [48,49], breast [50], pleura [51-53], lymph 
nodes  [54],  mediastinum  [55,56],  heart  [57-61],  retroperitoneum  [62],  ileum  [63-65], 
peritoneum  [66],  testis  [67],  bladder  [68,69],  penis  [70],  vulva  [71],  and  so  on.  In  10%  of 
cases the disease is multifocal [72]. 

Mortality varies depending on primary tumor site: the mortality range is 13% for EHE of soft 
tissues,  31%  for  EHE  of  the  bone,  43%  for  EHE  of  the  liver [10]  and  65%  for  EHE  of  the 
lung [14]. 

Primary  vascular  EHEs  represent  about  50%  of  reported  cases.  They  arise  from  a  blood 
vessel  [73],  commonly  small-  to  moderate-sized  veins,  such  as  the  femoral,  iliac  or  jugular 
veins, but also larger vascular structures such as the aorta or vena cava. Few cases originate 
from  medium-  to  small-sized  peripheral  vessels.  The  intravascular  subtypes  are  extremely 
rare [74]. 

Usually, EHEs present clinically as a painless elastic soft mass in the vicinity of a peripheral 
vessel  causing  symptoms  and  signs  of  deep  venous  occlusion,  ranging  from  edema  of  the 
extremities,  weakness  and  ischemia,  to  superior  vein  cava  syndrome.  Microscopically,  they 
are  associated  with  a  blood  vessel,  usually  a  medium-sized  vein  [29],  showing  first  an 
expansion  of  the  affected  blood  vessel  and  then  an  involvement  of  the  surrounding  soft 
tissues, with a centrifugal proliferation pattern. It is often difficult to make a correct diagnosis 
in  the  early  phase.  This  is  partly  because  they  are  extremely  rare  and  also  because  their 
imaging  characteristics  are  nonspecific,  resembling  inflammatory  or  atherosclerotic  lesions 
[24]. Ultrasonography is useful to define the morphology and vascularization of these masses 
and  to  evaluate  blood  flow,  usually  showing  intraluminal  defects  and  altered  flow  patterns, 
loss  of  plasticity  and  velocity  increase  [75].  On  the  other  hand,  MRI  can  give  additional 
information  about  the  involvement  of  surrounding  soft  tissues  and  cleavage  planes,  in 
addition  to  morphological  features  [27].  However,  definitive  radiological  diagnosis  is  often 
hard, and only histological diagnosis can be conclusive. 

Forty-three case reports on primary vascular EHE of both veins and arteries (except the aorta) 
have been described in the literature (Table 1). The involved vessels were the thoracic aorta 
[76,77], aortoiliac segment [78], radial artery [27], inferior vena cava [79-81] , superior vena 
cava  [82-86],  innominate  vein  [55,87-91],  azygos  vein  [92-94],  femoral  vein  [73,74,78,94-
98],  femoral  artery  [99]  iliac  veins  [28,100,101],  internal  carotid  artery  [24],  axillary  vein 
[102], brachial vein [103] or artery [104-107], popliteal artery [108], pulmonary artery [109], 
occipital artery [110], temporal artery [111], meningeal artery [112], and digital artery [113]. 
Age of presentation ranged from 11 to 79 years (mean age was 39 years), and the distribution 
among the two sexes was almost equal, with a slight predominance of the female sex (59% 
vs. 41%). The diameter of the masses was variable, ranging from 0.5cm to 11cm. Almost all 
patients  underwent  surgical  removal  of  the  vascular  EHE;  in  four  cases  resection  was  not 
complete, with macroscopic residual mass or microscopic positive margins. After treatment, 
patients  were  monitored  for  follow-up  (2  to  108  months).  Six  patients  (14%)  developed 
distant  metastases,  especially  liver  and  lung  metastases,  even  if  this  occurrence  did  not 
always affect the overall survival when metastasectomy was performed. Three patients (7%) 
had  local  relapse,  often  in  the  cases  treated  by  incomplete  surgical  removal;  relapse  was 
always treated with a second surgery. Postoperative RT was administered in only five cases, 
and chemotherapy in three patients.

The treatment  options for EHE include surgery, RT, and chemotherapy;  new therapies  such 
as antiangiogenetics agents have been also used. Few cases of spontaneous regression of EHE 
have been reported [114]. 

When  feasible,  surgery  with  free  resection  margins  is  the  treatment  of  choice  in  the 
management  of  EHE.  For  example,  partial  hepatectomy  [115]  or  orthotopic  liver 
transplantation [116] represent the first treatment in primary hepatic tumors. Embolization of 
feeding vessels causing spontaneous regression of vascular tumors has been described [117]. 
When feasible, a wide resection is also recommended in primary bone EHEs. A preoperative 
selective  embolization  of  involved  vertebra  may  help  to  reduce  intraoperative  blood  loss 
[118].  Surgery  is  the  mainstay  also  in  the  treatment  of  primary  vascular  EHE.  When 
reconstruction  of  the  vessel  is  necessary,  it  can  be  done  with  prosthetic  or  autogenous 
interposition graft replacement [100]. A complete local excision of the neoformation with or 
without local lymphadenectomy is related to long-term survival. 

A  few  patients  have  been  treated  with  chemotherapy,  often  in  the  metastatic  setting,  but 
results are not  always encouraging and response of EHE to  chemotherapy seems  to  be low. 
The mainstay chemotherapeutic agents for metastatic EHE are doxorubicin and fluorouracil. 
Intensive regimens using combinations of vincristine, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, etoposide and 
cyclophosphamide have shown an increase in response rate, without an advantage in overall 
survival  [10].  Doxorubicin  in  the  pegylated  liposomal  formulation  seems  to  lead  to  better 
responses [119] and reduce the risk of cardiotoxicity [120]. 

Due to the endothelial origin of EHE and the good response to therapies with interferon (IFN) 
alpha  [121,122],  recent  therapeutic  approaches  have  focused  on  the  use  of  antiangiogenic 
agents  [123].  Bevacizumab  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against  vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  and  seems  to  be  an  effective  and  well-tolerated  treatment  for 
metastatic  or  locally  advanced  angiosarcoma  and  epithelioid  hemangioendotheliomas 
[124,125].  Thalidomide  [126,127],  lenalidomide  [128],  and  endostar  [129]  are  believed  to 
have  immunomodulatory  and  antiangiogenic  properties;  they  also  seem  to  be  useful  in  the 
systemic  treatment  of  EHE.  Sorafenib  [130]  is  also  providing  encouraging  evidence  of 
benefit. 

Selective  radionuclide  therapy  with  intra-arterial  injection  of  Yttrium  (Y)-90  microspheres 
[131],  commonly  used  for  unresectable  liver  metastases  and  primary  liver  tumors  with 
hopeful results, has shown some results in unresectable hepatic EHE. 

In  consideration  of  the  high  incidence  of  local  relapse  and  the  moderate  radiosensitivity  of 
EHE,  RT  has  been  used  as  adjuvant  treatment  in  some  high-risk  cases,  with  good  results. 
Hemangiomas involving  the skeletal system have been treated effectively  with  local  RT for 
many decades with a good long-term local control [132], even when RT is used as the only 
treatment option, such as in cases of surgically inaccessible sites [133]. 

Scott  et  al.  [134]  treated  14  patients  affected  by  bone  EHE  with  adjuvant  or  exclusive  RT. 
The median dose administered was 54Gy for the patients treated with RT alone and 62.2Gy 
for  the  patients  who  underwent  surgery,  with  a  once  daily  (1.5  to  2Gy)  or  twice  daily 
fractionation  (1.2Gy). At a median  follow up of  10.3  years, the 5-year local  control, cause-
specific  survival,  and  overall  survival  rates  were  100%,  86%,  and  79%,  respectively.  No 
cases of late toxicity greater than G1 were recorded, suggesting that RT is a highly effective 
treatment option for this disease. Yin et al. [135] described a case of complete remission of a 

cervical spine EHE after the sole administration of 55Gy in 32 fractions over 43 days, using a 
6MV  photon  three-field  plan.  No  severe  side  effects  were  recorded,  but  the  authors 
highlighted the risk of second malignancies. RT was also  effective in obtaining a long-term 
local  control  when  it  was  administered  as  adjuvant  treatment  [136],  as  in  cases  when 
complete  surgical  removal  was  not  feasible  [137,138].  No  direct  comparisons  between 
surgery and radiotherapy have been published; however, high-dose radiotherapy seems to be 
curative when used as primary or adjuvant treatment in EHE of the spine [139,140]. Although 
re-resection is the treatment of choice in cases of EHE after surgery, RT showed efficacy also 
when  administered  as  salvage  therapy,  as  in  the  case  of  EHE  of  the  mastoid  described  by 
Drazin  et  al.;  the  total  dose  administered  at  recurrence  was  59.4Gy  in  33  fractions.  The 
patient was free from disease 8 years after surgery [48]. 

The role of RT in primary vascular EHE has not been established. Few data are available, and 
it is difficult to summarize guidelines about when this treatment should be performed, that is 
preoperatively, postoperatively, in the case of incomplete resection, or only at the moment of 
tumor progression. Hampers and Tomaino  described the case of a patient with  an EHE that 
presented  as  an  aneurysm  of  the  superficial  palmar  arch  and  third  common  digital  artery 
[113]. The lesion was completely surgically removed and the patient  received postoperative 
local  irradiation  to  the  hand  because  surgeons  and  pathologists  could  not  verify  tumor-free 
margins; dose and fraction size were not specified. The patient was free from local or distant 
recurrence at the 1-year follow-up evaluation. Muñoz et al. described a case of external iliac 
vein EHE with lymph node metastases treated by surgery and local RT [100]. Unfortunately, 
doses  and  volumes  were  not  specified  in  the  report.  The  patient  was  alive  without  local 
relapse  at  8-year  follow-up.  Toursarkissian  et  al.  described  a  case  of  EHE  arising  from  the 
innominate  vein  treated  with  surgery  and  radiation  therapy.  The  patient  was  alive  at  a  4.5-
year follow-up  without evidence of local  relapse  [90]. In the  experience of Harris  et al., an 
EHE  of  the  external  iliac  vein  with  lymph-node  involvement  in  a  32-year-old  man  was 
treated with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy, because microscopic foci of the tumor were 
seen  extending  to  the  margins  of  the  resection.  The  total  dose  administered  was  66Gy,  and 
the patient was free from relapse after 12 months [28]. 

Conclusions 

Primary  vascular  EHEs  are  rare  and  publications  in  the  worldwide  literature  are  almost 
exclusively case reports. Primary vascular EHEs can occur in every age group. Surgery is the 
preferred treatment, when feasible. Chemotherapy is often used in cases of metastatic disease, 
with ambiguous results. The case reported here suggests that the addition of postoperative RT 
may  be useful in  cases  where tumor margins  are close or  cannot  be assessed, or those with 
high-risk features. Unfortunately, EHE behavior often remains unpredictable and unrelated to 
microscopic findings.
