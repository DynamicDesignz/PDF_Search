Abstract 
Introduction 

Heterotopic  pancreas  is  defined  as  pancreatic  tissue  without  a  real  anatomical  or  vascular 
connection  to  the  pancreas.  It  can  be  found  in  the  stomach,  duodenum,  jejunum,  ileum, 
Meckel’s  diverticulum,  colon  gall  bladder,  umbilicus,  fallopian  tube,  mediastinum,  spleen 
and  liver.  Complications  of  heterotopic  pancreas  are  inflammation,  bleeding,  obstruction, 
malignant transformation, carcinoid syndrome, jejunojejunal intussusception and ileus, but it 
is usually asymptomatic and diagnosed only during examinations for other diseases. 

Case presentation 

An  81-year-old  Lithuanian  woman  was  diagnosed  with  caecal  cancer  and  had  undergone 
elective  surgery.  A  right  hemicolectomy  was  performed  and  a  Meckel’s  diverticulum  was 
observed and excised. Histological results showed a poorly differentiated G3 adenocarcinoma 
of  her  large  intestine  and  heterotopic  pancreas  tissue  in  the  Meckel’s  diverticulum  and 
mesenteric adipose tissue. 

Conclusions 

Asymptomatic  heterotopic  pancreas  is  rarely  diagnosed,  and  usually  found  incidentally 
during  surgical  or  diagnostic  interventions.  Although  it  has  no  symptoms,  heterotopic 
pancreas found during surgical procedures should be excised.

Introduction 
Heterotopic pancreas (HP) is defined as pancreatic tissue without real anatomical or vascular 
connection  to  the  pancreas  and  was  first  reported  by  Jean-Schultz  in  1729  [1,2].  The 
incidence of HP is 0.5 to 13.0% in autopsy studies [3]. The most common sites of HP are the 
stomach,  duodenum,  and  jejunum,  but  it  can  be  also  found  in  the  ileum,  Meckel’s 
diverticulum (MD), colon, gall bladder, umbilicus, fallopian tube, mediastinum, spleen, and 
liver [4]. HP can cause complications including inflammation, ulceration, chemical irritation, 
bleeding, obstruction, malignant transformation, jejunojejunal intussusception and ileus [5-8]. 
However,  most  patients  with  ectopic  pancreas  are  asymptomatic  and  diagnosis  is  usually 
confirmed  during  a  radiological  examination  or  endoscopy  of  the  digestive  tract  or  during 
surgical explorations motivated by other diseases [9]. On microscopic examination, ectopic 
pancreas is composed of varying amounts of pancreatic ducts, acini and islets of Langerhans 
[7].  Heinrich’s  criteria  are  used  to  classify  HP:  type  1  contains  cells  of  exocrine  glands, 
excretory ducts and islets of Langerhans; type 2 contains only excretory glands and excretory 
ducts; type 3 contains only excretory ducts [10]. We report an unusual case of HP found in 
MD. 
Case presentation 
An  81-year-old  Lithuanian  woman  was  tested  for  faecal  occult  blood  during  preventive 
colorectal cancer screening. Test results were positive and she underwent a colonoscopy. The 
colonoscopy  revealed  a  tumour  in  her  caecum.  Abdominal  and  thoracic  computed 
tomography  (CT)  scanning  revealed  no  metastasis.  She  then  underwent  elective  surgery. 
During the operation, a 6×5cm tumour was found in her caecum. Her MD was found 40cm 
from the hepatoduodenal ligament [6]. A right hemicolectomy was performed to excise the 
MD from her jejunal loop. After the operation, she underwent chemotherapy. There were no 
complications related to the surgery. Histological results showed a poorly differentiated G3 
adenocarcinoma of the caecum. In her small intestine a muscular layer of excised MD and 
mesenteric  adipose  tissue  was  found,  which  was  pancreatic  tissue  morphologically. 

Microscopic analysis revealed pancreatic tissue without islets of Langerhans (Figure 1) in the 
small  intestine and  mesenteric adipose tissue. Moreover, in the HP tissue, dilatation of the 
pancreatic ducts was observed. 

Figure 1 Histological section (hematoxylin and eosin ×200) of the small intestine. The figure 
shows the presence of pancreatic tissue (black arrow – pancreatic acini) in the small intestine 
and a muscular layer of Meckel’s diverticulum with cystic dilatation of the ducts (blue 
arrow). 
Discussion 
The aetiology of HP, otherwise known as “aberrant”, “ectopic”, or “accessory” pancreas, is 
still unclear, but it is believed to arise embryonically during rotation of the foregut and fusion 
of  the  dorsal  and  ventral  pancreatic  buds.  Some  tissue  separates  from  the  pancreas  and 
develops  into  HP  in  any  portion  of  the  alimentary  system.  Another  best  known  theory  is 
based on the pancreatic metaplasia of endodermal tissue [4,5]. Because of the proximity of 
the  embryonic  pancreatic  primordial  buds  and  the  foregut  during  development,  it  is  not 
surprising that 70 to 90% of ectopic pancreas occurs in the upper gastrointestinal system [9]. 
MD is the second most common site of heterotopic tissue; the stomach is the most common 
site (50 to 60% of cases) while 5 to 16% of cases occur in the pancreas [9]. Surgical excision 
is  the  first  and  best  choice  of  treatment  because  medical  treatment  is  not  effective  [5]. 
However, the treatment of HP depends on the patient. Asymptomatic patients with a positive 
diagnosis must remain under medical supervision and be reviewed periodically. Symptomatic 
patients  without  complications  should  have  their  lesions  excised,  preferably  by  local 
resection. In sites accessible by fibrescope, endoscopic removal may be performed. HP found 
during surgical procedures motivated by other diseases, as in our case, should be excised and 
submitted  for  a  frozen  section  study  whenever  necessary, 
thus  avoiding  possible 
complications  and  the  need  for  reoperation.  In  cases  of  lesions  associated  with  bleeding, 
obstruction or suspicion of malignancy, an appropriate surgical approach is undertaken [9]. 
HP  can  be  eliminated  by  simple  excision,  as  multiple  lesions  are  unusual  [11].  The 
preoperative diagnosis of HP in the small intestine is difficult. Symptoms depend on the size 
of lesion and involvement of mucosa. On clinical examination, significant lesions are greater 
than 1.5cm [7,9]. Most cases represent HP in a MD with gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 1), 
but in our case it was asymptomatic. Because HP can be found submucosally and the most 
common submucosal tumour is gastrointestinal stroma tumour (GIST), HP can frequently be 
mistaken as GIST or leiomyoma at endoscopy, ultrasonography or CT scanning [12]. In our 
case,  HP  was  mistaken  for  metastasis  of  the  caecal  tumour.  The  definitive  diagnosis  is 
confirmed  by  pathological  examination  after  the  resection  (Table  2).  However,  endoscopic 
ultrasound findings are often associated with these lesions: a diameter larger than 4cm, poorly 
defined  margins,  cystic  spaces  and  internal  echogenic  foci,  and  adjacent  lymphadenopathy 
and rapid  growth  [13].  Although, pathological examination is  the  most accurate  diagnostic 
method  for  diagnosis  of  ectopic  pancreas,  most  biopsies  are  inconclusive,  because  it  is 
difficult  to  take  adequate  tissue  samples.  MD  can  be  diagnosed  with  99mtechnetium 
pertechnetate  scintigraphy,  which  detects  ectopic  gastric  mucosa  in  MD.  However,  the 
diagnostic accuracy of this method is 46% in adults. Abdominal ultrasound, X-ray and CT 
usually  give  nonspecific  findings.  MD  can  be  detected  by  capsule  endoscopy  or  double-
balloon  enteroscopy.  The  diagnosis  of  MD  with  HP  is  difficult  [6,14].  Management  of 
incidentally  found  MD  is  controversial.  Some  authors  suggest  that  indications  for 
diverticulectomy  should  be  based  on  intraoperative  findings.  Wide-mouthed,  thin-walled 

diverticula  without  bands  could  be  left  undisturbed,  whereas  thickened,  narrow-based 
diverticula should be resected. However, there are no definite anatomic criteria to predict the 
probability  of  future  complications.  According  to  the  literature,  the  benefits  of  incidental 
diverticulectomy outweigh its attending morbidity and mortality [15]. In our case, MD was 
resected  because  ectopy  of  the  pancreatic  tissue  was  considered  a  metastasis  of  the  caecal 
tumour.

Conclusions 
If  HP  is  asymptomatic,  as  in  our  case,  diagnosis  is  unlikely  without  surgical  intervention. 
Surgical interventions are usually performed in other diseases. Because of its complications 
and  chance  of  malignant  transformation,  HP  found  during  surgical  procedure  should  be 
excised.
