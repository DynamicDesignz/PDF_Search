Abstract 

Introduction 

Pulmonary  alveolar  proteinosis  is  characterized  by  accumulation  of  surfactant  and 
phospholipids  in  the  pulmonary  alveoli.  Whole  lung  lavage  is  considered  the  first-line 
therapy,  which  requires  special  techniques.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  have  only 
been limited reports that have demonstrated the effectiveness of ambroxol on a mild case of 
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 

Case presentation 

A  72-year-old  Japanese  woman  presented  to  our  hospital  with  a  one-year  history  of 
productive cough and progressive dyspnea. Her chest computed tomography scan showed a 
bilateral  crazy-paving  pattern  in  both  of  her  lungs.  She  was  diagnosed  with  autoimmune 
pulmonary alveolar proteinosis based on bronchoalveolar lavage findings and the presence of 
serum  anti-granulocyte  macrophage  colony-stimulating  factor  antibodies.  She  was  severely 
hypoxemic,  so  we  recommended  whole  lung  lavage  or  inhaled  granulocyte  macrophage 

colony-stimulating factor treatment, which she refused. We initiated treatment with ambroxol 
and her symptoms markedly improved. 

Conclusions 

Although whole lung lavage is the first-line therapy for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, oral 
ambroxol could be an  alternative  treatment  option,  even in  patients with severe  respiratory 
compromise.

Introduction 

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare interstitial disease caused by accumulation of 
surfactant and phospholipids in the pulmonary alveoli, resulting in dyspnea, cough, fatigue, 
and  a  crazy-paving  pattern  on  chest  computed  tomography  (CT)  [1].  PAP  is  classified  as 
autoimmune or non-autoimmune, including secondary and congenital PAP; more than 90% 
of  cases  are  diagnosed  as  autoimmune  PAP  [2].  The  pathogenesis  of  autoimmune  PAP 
involves  a  neutralizing  antibody  that  directly  binds  to  granulocyte-macrophage  colony-
stimulating  factor  (GM-CSF)  and  blocks  its  binding  to  GM-CSF  receptors  on  cells,  which 
leads to inhibition of signaling, thereby inhibiting surfactant maturation [3]. Although whole 
lung lavage (WLL) remains the current standard of care for PAP, other therapies, including 
inhaled  GM-CSF,  rituximab,  and  plasmapheresis  [4,5]  have  been  proposed.  A  few  studies 
have reported that ambroxol, a commonly used expectorant, can relieve PAP [6,7]. Here, we 
report a case of autoimmune PAP with chronic severe hypoxemia, which responded to oral 
administration of ambroxol. 

Case presentation 

A  72-year-old  Japanese  woman  presented  to  our  hospital  with  a  one-year  history  of 
productive  cough  and  progressive  dyspnea  on  exertion.  Her  past  medical  history  included 
only  osteomyelitis  at  35-years-old  and  she  was  not  taking  any  medications.  She  had  never 
smoked  or  inhaled  dust  as  an  occupational  hazard.  Her  vital  signs  were  as  follows:  body 
temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure of 130/80mmHg, heart rate of 67 beats/min, and SpO2 
level of 80% (room air). Her arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.44, PaO2 level of 
−  level  of  26.4mEq/L  on  room  air.  Her 
43.2mmHg,  PaCO2  level  of  39.2mmHg,  and  HCO3
chest radiographs (CXR) showed bilateral infiltrates in her mid and lower lung zones (Figure 
1A),  and  her  chest  CT  scan  showed  bilateral  ground  glass  opacities  with  thickened 
interlobular septa, an appearance known as the ‘crazy-paving’ pattern (Figure 2A). 

Her  laboratory  tests  revealed  a  normal  complete  blood  count,  high  lactate  dehydrogenase 
(543/mL), and high  Krebs von den  Lungen-6 level (16,189U/mL). Her pulmonary function 
tests  taken  on  admission  revealed  a  vital  capacity  (VC)  of  1.49L,  %VC  of  68.6%,  forced 
expiratory  volume  in  one  second  (FEV1)  of  1.17L,  FEV1/forced  vital  capacity  (FVC) 
predicted ratio of 76.0%, and FEV1/FVC actual ratio of 84.2%. We retrieved 26/100mL of 
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which was milky in appearance. Her BALF total cell 

count was 6.0×104/mL;  cell differentiation revealed 23% neutrophils, 1% eosinophils, 17% 
lymphocytes,  and  59%  macrophages.  Her  BALF  contained  copious  eosinophilic,  periodic 
acid  Schiff-positive  granular  material,  a  finding  that  supported  a  diagnosis  of  PAP.  In 
addition,  a  high  level  of  anti  GM-CSF  antibody  was  detected  in  her  serum  (57.5µg/mL), 
leading to a diagnosis of autoimmune PAP. Her disease severity score (DSS) was classified 
as DSS 5, based on severe hypoxemia (PaO2 level of 43.2mmHg).

admission. (B) CXR findings improved after one month of treatment with ambroxol. 

Figure 2 Chest computed tomography (CT) scan before and after the treatment. (A) Chest 
CT scan on admission. (B) Chest CT scan after five months of treatment with ambroxol

Considering her severe DSS, we recommended treatment with WLL under general anesthesia 
or inhaled GM-CSF therapy. However, she refused both treatments because of concern about 
complications  and  medical  costs;  she  also  refused  hospitalization.  Therefore,  we  started 
domiciliary oxygen therapy and an alternative treatment of 45mg/day of ambroxol (TEIJIN 
PHARMA,  Tokyo,  Japan).  She  was  discharged,  with  frequent  scheduled  checkup 
examinations  at  our  outpatient  clinic.  A  few  days  after  starting  ambroxol,  she  showed 
loosened  phlegm  and  reduced  cough,  with  progressively  improving  dyspnea.  Her  oxygen 
saturation level in room air rose to 95%, and her CXR results showed improvement after one 
month  (Figure  1B).  Her  chest  CT  scan  after  five  months  of  treatment  showed  almost  no 
abnormal shadows (Figure 2B), and her pulmonary function was improved (VC of 1.88L and 
%VC  of  90.4%).  She  has  continued  ambroxol  treatment  for  17  months  without  disease 
progression. 

Discussion 

PAP  is  a  rare  lung  disease  characterized  by  the  intra-alveolar  accumulation  of  surfactant 
lipids  and  proteins,  which  impairs  gas  exchange  and  results  in  respiratory  failure  [3].  The 
majority of PAP is autoimmune PAP. Dranoff et al. found that an absence of local GM-CSF-
dependent  activation  of  macrophage  in  the  lungs  is  involved  in  surfactant  clearance  [8]. 
Autoimmune  PAP  is  now  considered  to  occur  via  a  neutralizing  antibody,  which  inhibits 
GM-CSF  binding  to  receptors  [3].  This  leads  to  a  defect  of  alveolar  macrophages  and 
abnormal  surfactant  metabolism,  which results  in  intra-alveolar  accumulation  of  surfactant. 
WLL,  the  standard  therapy  for  PAP,  has  beneficial  effects  in  approximately  two  thirds  of 
patients,  however,  it  requires  special  techniques  and  carries  the  risk  of  complications, 
including  hypoxemia,  hydropneumothorax,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  and  post-
procedure  infections  [1].  Inhaled  GM-CSF  has  also  been  reported  as  effective  therapy; 
Tazawa  et  al.  conducted  a  phase  II  trial  of  GM-CSF  therapy  for  PAP  [9].  Of  35  patients 
completing GM-CSF therapy, 24 improved, resulting in an overall response rate of 62% (24 
out  of  39;  intension-to-treat  analysis).  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  rituximab  and 
plasmapheresis  in  PAP  patients  is  now  being  studied  [1].  Our  patient  was  a  candidate  for 
WLL and inhaled GM-CSF treatment because she had severe hypoxemia and was classified 
as DSS 5 [1]. However, she refused our recommendations because she feared complications 
and medical costs, so we chose conservative treatment with ambroxol. 

The  potential  effects  of  ambroxol  for  PAP  can  be  evaluated  based  only  on  limited  case 
reports, because controlled trials have not been conducted. Diaz et al. first reported the use of 
ambroxol in  a  PAP  patient  in 1984,  with  inhalation  of  30mg  of  ambroxol  every  six  hours, 
leading  to  resolution  of  symptoms  and  improvement  in  CXR  findings  and  pulmonary 
function  tests  [7].  However,  details  about  the  patient’s  characteristics  were  not  described. 
Only  three  additional  articles  about  the  efficacy  of  ambroxol  for  PAP  are  available  in  the 
PubMed database in English. Hashizume described improvement in a patient with mild PAP 
(PaO2  level  of  61.3mmHg  versus  43.2mmHg  in  our  patient)  treated  with  45mg/day  of 
ambroxol [6]. Mahut et al. described a pediatric patient who experienced a 10-year remission 
from PAP with ambroxol treatment, but the report concluded that the remission might have 
been spontaneous [10]. Garcia et al. reported the unsuccessful treatment of two PAP patients 
with oral ambroxol [11]. It remains unclear which patients will benefit from ambroxol and 
how  ambroxol  affects  the  pathophysiology  of  PAP.  Ambroxol  may  act  on  type  II 
pneumocytes,  which 
in  alveolar 
macrophages,  probably  through  an  improvement  in  surfactant  secretion  and  uptake  system 
[12]. We hypothesize that this may improve PAP. 

to  chemicophysical  and  functional  changes 

leads 

Our patient was successfully treated with oral ambroxol, despite the severity of her disease. 
Though  WLL  or  inhaled  GM-CSF  therapy  remains  the  first-line  therapy  for  PAP,  oral 
ambroxol  could  be  an  alternative  treatment  option  for  patients  with  PAP  who  have  severe 
respiratory compromise, especially if WLL and inhaled GM-CSF therapy is not feasible, as it 
is a simple treatment and with few side effects. 

Spontaneous  resolution  occurs  in  an  estimated  7.9%  of  PAP  patients  [13].  However, 
spontaneous resolution in patients with a PaO2 level of less than 60mmHg is considered very 
rare [6]. Our patient had a PaO2 level of 43.2mmHg and her symptoms had been worsening 
for  more  than  a  year  leading  to  a  diagnosis  at  the  most  severe  stage  of  the  disease. 
Furthermore,  her  symptoms  immediately  improved  after  initiating  ambroxol.  Hence,  we 
reasonably  conclude  that  ambroxol,  not  spontaneous  resolution,  contributed  to  the  relief  of 
her PAP. 

Conclusions 

Ambroxol can improve PAP, even in patients with severe respiratory compromise. Although 
WLL  is  the  first-line  therapy  for  PAP,  oral  administration  of  ambroxol  should  also  be 
considered.
