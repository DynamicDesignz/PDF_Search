Abstract

Introduction: Intraosseous lipoma is a benign bone tumor, and the tumor occurs more frequently in the lower
extremities. We present a very rare case of intraosseous lipoma occurring in the lumbar vertebral arch and spinous
process.
Case presentation: A 54-year-old Japanese man presented with a three-month history of lumbar pain. Magnetic
resonance imaging of the L3 vertebral arch and spinous process revealed high intensity on T1- and T2-weighted
imaging, and it was suppressed on fat-suppression imaging and no enhancement showed on gadolinium
contrast-enhanced imaging. Computed tomography imaging revealed an osteolytic change accompanied by
marginal osteosclerosis in his third lumbar vertebral arch and spinous process, as well as a thinned and bulging
bone cortex. An analgesic had been administered prior to his visit, but low back pain had persisted, so we
performed curettage and filled the defect with hydroxyapatite bone. His low back pain was improved immediately
after surgery, and no recurrence of tumor has been observed on computed tomography imaging as of three years
postoperatively.
Conclusions: Symptomatic intraosseous lipoma of spine is very rare, but the patient may be surgically well-treated
by curettage and reconstruction of the benign tumor.

Introduction
Intraosseous lipoma is a benign bone tumor, and the
tumor occurs more frequently in the lower extremities.
We present a very rare case of
intraosseous lipoma
occurring in the lumbar vertebral arch and spinous
process, together with a discussion of the literature.

Case presentation
A 54-year-old Japanese man presented to our university-
affiliated hospital with a three-month history of lumbar
pain. He was 167cm in height and weighed 58kg. An
analgesic had been administered prior to his visit, but
low back pain had persisted. His physical examination
showed pressure pain and tapping tenderness at the third
lumbar vertebral level, but no sensory or motor disorders
of his lower extremities. His blood biochemistry showed

no abnormalities and his medical history was non-
contributory.

A plain radiography revealed the formation of a verte-
bral spur or narrowing of the intervertebral disc between
L3 and L4 as an age-related change, but no instability
was evident between vertebrae and no obvious ab-
normalities were evident. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) of the L3 vertebral arch and spinous process
revealed high intensity on T1- and T2-weighted imaging
(Figure 1A,B,C), and it was suppressed on fat-suppression
imaging (Figure 1D) and no enhancement showed on
gadolinium (Gd) contrast-enhanced imaging (Figure 1E).
Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed an osteo-
lytic change accompanied by marginal osteosclerosis in
his third lumbar vertebral arch and spinous process, as
well as a thinned and bulging bone cortex (Figure 2).
Hounsfield units (HU) of CT for the area at which the
osteolytic change was observed was −87HU, a value ap-
proximating that of fatty tissue, and areas of ossification
or calcification were observed.

Based on the above findings, although we suspected
painful lipoma in the third lumbar vertebral arch and
spinous process segment, we decided to perform a
biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Since a benign tumor
was suspected, we planned to perform curettage of the
tumor and to fill the defect with artificial bone.

The operation was performed under general anesthesia.
The third lumbar vertebral arch was exposed, and when
an area approximately 1cm × 1cm in the external lamina
of the right vertebral arch was opened, a yellow tumorous
lesion with a color and elasticity macroscopically similar to
those of ordinary fatty tissue was observed. The tumorous
lesion was curetted away as much as possible, hydroxya-
patite bone filler paste (BIOPEX®; HOYA Corporation,

Tokyo, Japan) was used to fill the defect and the external
lamina of the vertebral arch was replaced. Intraoperative
pathological findings included hyperplasia of adipose cells
and blood vessels, a small amount of trabecular bone and
adipose cells of different sizes. Intraosseous lipoma was
therefore diagnosed (Figure 3).

His low back pain was improved immediately after
surgery, and no recurrence of the tumor has been ob-
served on CT imaging as of three years postoperatively
(Figure 4).

Discussion
Despite the abundance of adipose connective tissue in
bone marrow, intraosseous lipoma is extremely rare [1];
a search of PubMed using the keywords ‘intraosseous
lipoma’ yielded 177 results. A review of
the search
results showed that intraosseous lipoma occurs more
frequently in the lower extremities, particularly in the

long bones

We performed a review of the literature on intra-
osseous lipoma involving the spine, identifying only 14
cases (Table 1); five cases (35%) occurred in the lumbar
region, four (28%) in the sacral region, three (21%) in
the cervical region, one (7%) in the thoracic region and
one (7%) in the coccygeal region [4-14]. A slight pre-
dominance towards the lumbar spine was seen com-
pared with other regions. The lesion in our patient also
occurred in the lumbar region. Intraosseous lipoma in
the lumbar region might occur at the vertebral body or
in the posterior element [8,12], with a slight predomi-
nance toward the vertebral body. However, our patient
presented with the lesion in the posterior element.

Even though intraosseous lipoma is a benign tumor
that can be successfully treated with conservative treat-
ment, surgery has been recommended for diagnostic
confirmation, painful tumors, pathological fractures and
malignant transformation [1-3,15,16]. In our patient, low
back pain persisted after conservative treatment, so we
performed curettage and filled the defect with hydroxy-
apatite bone. Most cases of intraosseous lipoma have no
pain, however, micro-movement of the periosteum of
the L3 vertebral arch and spinous process may have
caused our patient’s pain. Subsequently, the low back
pain of our patient was improved immediately after
filling the curetted defect with hydroxyapatite, and no
recurrence of tumor has been observed as of three years
postoperatively.
