Abstract

Introduction: Transposition is an anomaly of tooth position, the most frequent of which involves the canine and
the first maxillary premolar. We describe the orthodontic treatment of a unilateral transposition of an upper canine
and an upper right first premolar in the permanent dentition.
Case presentation: A 12-year-old Caucasian boy presented with transposition of his upper right canine and upper
right first premolar. He had combined surgical-orthodontic treatment to correct the transposition and to obtain a
Class I relationship between the molar and canine. This treatment resolved the dental crowding and achieved good
functional and aesthetic results.
Conclusion: In transposition, the choice of the most suitable treatment depends on the occlusion, level of dental
crowding, aesthetics, position of the radicular apices, and the specific needs of the patient. In this case, orthodontic
alignment of the transposed teeth into their physiological position achieved all of our objectives and our patient
was satisfied with the aesthetic results obtained.

Introduction
Transposition is a form of ectopic eruption, defined as
the positional interchange of two adjacent teeth within
the same quadrant of the dental arch [1,2]. Transpos-
ition can be complete or incomplete. In complete trans-
position, the entire dental structure (root and crown) is
in an ectopic position. In incomplete transposition (also
called pseudo- or partial transposition), the crowns are
ectopic, but the roots are in the correct position [1].

Transpositions mostly involve the upper arch and are
unilateral [3-5]. To the best of our knowledge, transpos-
ition has never been observed in both dental arches or
in the deciduous dentition [1,6]. By analyzing a sample
of 201 cases, Peck and Peck [2] identified five types of
transposition: upper canine-first premolar; upper canine-
lateral
incisor; upper canine-first molar; upper lateral
incisor-central incisor; and lower lateral incisor-canine
[3]. Of all the teeth, the permanent maxillary canines are
the most frequently transposed. The most common type

of transposition is between the canine and first maxillary
premolar, followed by transposition between the canine
and the lateral incisor, central incisor, second premolar,
and first premolar in the lower arch [1-3,7]. On the trans-
posed side, it is not unusual to find agenesis of the lateral
incisors and second premolars, or to find inclusions of the
canines and central incisors [5,6,8-10]. Microdontia also
very frequently occurs with transpositions.

Transposition between the canine and the first maxil-
lary premolar occurs in 0.135% to 0.510% of the popula-
tion [4,6,11]. In Japan, the incidence ranges from 0.065%
in the general population to 0.660% in orthodontic pa-
tients [11-14]. Elsewhere, occurrence ranges from 0.380%
in a Turkish population [11,15]
to 0.510% in Africa
[11,16]. In a study of 2349 children between 2 and 12
years of age, Buenviaje and Rapp found that the preva-
lence of transposed teeth was 0.080% [11,17].

This type of transposition shows the following charac-
teristics [3]: the deciduous canine is present; the canine
is positioned between the first and second premolars;
the canine is positioned towards the vestibule; the first
premolar is mesiopalatal; and the transposition area

Postulated causes of tooth transposition include in-
tooth buds during development
version of
[4,8,15,18], alteration of
the tooth eruption pattern
[4,15,18,19], the presence of deciduous teeth beyond
the maximum time limit for the development of the
permanent teeth [4,15,18,20], and dental trauma during
childhood [4,15,18,21]. However, evidence also exists
for genetic factors, including the increased prevalence
of transposition in females [1,8], on the left side [1,8],
and in patients with hypodontia [1,8] or Down Syn-
drome [22]. Accordingly, it has been suggested that the
etiology of
tooth transposition has a genetic basis,
within a picture of multifactorial heredity [3,8,23-25].

The treatment of transpositions can be classified as
interceptive or definitive, depending on when the trans-
position is diagnosed, although in some cases these two
treatment types can overlap [3,9]. Interceptive treatment
is performed on patients between six and eight years of
age after orthopantomography of the dental arches and a
thorough intraoral examination reveal the presence of
tooth transposition at the initial stage. This treatment
involves extraction of the retained deciduous teeth, posi-
tioning of the permanent lateral incisor in its physio-
logical position, and maintenance of the space for the
permanent canine. Interceptive treatment can be adopted
before transposition is complete, which normally occurs
around 10 years of age. After that time, definitive treat-
ment should be adopted [3,9]. Definitive treatment in-
volves three steps: extraction of one of the transposed
teeth, alignment of the teeth in the transposed position,
and orthodontic correction and alignment of teeth in the
correct position [26,27]. The decision is affected by several
factors, such as the patient’s degree of occlusion and den-
tal crowding, aesthetics, the position of the radicular api-
ces, socio-economic factors, and the patient’s motivation.

We present the case of a patient with transposition be-
tween the canine and first premolar, demonstrating three
of the typical characteristics: he still had the deciduous
canine; orthopantomography determined that the canine
was positioned between the first and second premolars;
and clinical observation showed that the canine was po-
sitioned towards the vestibule. We successfully treated
the transposition with definitive treatment.

Case presentation
We describe the case of a 12-year-old male Caucasian
patient in the permanent dentition period. An extraoral
examination did not reveal any serious facial asymmetry.
An intraoral examination revealed the presence of his
deciduous upper right canine in the arch, the absence of
the corresponding canine, and microdontia of his upper
lateral incisors. His left lateral incisor showed a crossbite

relationship with his lower left canine. A class I molar
interocclusal relationship was present on his right and
left sides, with minimal crowding in the front section of
his lower arch (Figure 1). No notable events were evi-
dent from our patient’s or his family’s medical history
that could be correlated with the altered tooth eruption
or position.

To determine an adequate treatment plan, our patient
underwent orthopantomography of his arches and
latero-lateral cranium teleradiography for cephalometric
evaluation. The orthopantomography highlighted the re-
tention of his right upper canine and its transposition
with his first premolar (Figure 2).

One possible treatment approach for this patient was to
align his teeth into the transposed position. Although this
approach would probably have required less time overall,
it had some disadvantages in terms of aesthetics and
occlusion. Therefore, a combined surgical-orthodontic
treatment was selected, with the aim of correcting the
transposition and aligning the teeth into their correct posi-
tions. The selected approach involved a surgical incision
in the mucosa proximal to the retained and transposed ca-
nine, traction of the tooth in the dental arch into its
physiological position using an anchorage device, and

banding of the dental arches to obtain alignment and lev-
eling. The proposed treatment was interceptive and was
chosen to prevent further impaction of the canine into the
first molar.

During the first session, a dental technician used a
band to take an impression of our patient’s upper teeth,
creating a splint with two eyelets in zones 12 and 13 to
ensure traction of the canine in the arch. The splint was
cemented (Figure 3) and, one week later, surgery was
performed. The oral surgeon made an incision in the
mucosa to expose the crown and created a trapezoidal
paramarginal flap (Figure 4). A button was placed at the
crown level and tied with an elastic wire to the more
distal eyelet of the splint to start the traction. The de-
ciduous canine was preserved to maintain the necessary
space for repositioning the permanent tooth. The elastic
wire was replaced approximately every 15 days to ensure
a slow and constant traction, in such a way as to avoid
damage to the periodontal tissue and the canine.

About two months after surgery, his tooth was visible
in the arch (Figure 5). Traction was continued by tying
an elastic wire to the mesial eyelet of the splint in zone
13. The more distal eyelet was removed. Four months
after surgery, the tooth was sufficiently visible (Figure 6)

to allow for removal of the splint, extraction of the de-
ciduous canine, replacement of
the button with an
orthodontic brace, and banding of the arches.

Bonding was performed with pre-torqued and pre-
angled brackets with a 0.022-inch slot. The first arch
used was a 0.014-inch nickel-titanium round arch, to
which the canine was directly tied (Figure 7). About two
months after the start of treatment, a 0.018-inch nickel-
titanium arch was applied. Once the crowding was re-
solved,
the intermediate stage was begun, and a
0.016×0.022-inch nickel-titanium arch was applied. For
the final stage, a 0.019×0.025-inch steel arch was used.

As soon as the canine reached its correct position in
the arch, the lower arch was banded. The same proced-
ure used for the upper arch was applied, using the same
braces and the same sequence of wires (Figure 8). Band-
ing was removed after the established objectives were
met, that is, the transposition was corrected and his
arches were aligned and leveled (Figure 9).

Our patient’s treatment lasted for two years. At the
end of the treatment, he had a good aesthetic outcome.
The median lines of occlusion were centered, his molars
were in a class I relationship, and his right upper canine
showed a slight gingival recession. The microdontic

incisors will be aesthetically reconstructed at a
later stage, and a decision will be made then as to
whether the reconstruction will be direct or indirect.

Conclusions
Transposition is an anomaly of tooth position, the most
frequent of which involves the canine and the first max-
illary premolar. The most suitable treatment depends on
the occlusion, level of dental crowding, aesthetics, pos-
ition of the radicular apices, and specific needs of the
patient. In this case, we opted for definitive treatment
with orthodontic alignment of the transposed teeth into
their physiological position. The treatment allowed us to
recover the permanent canine from the transposed pos-
ition and reposition it into its natural position. Our pa-
tient is satisfied with the aesthetic results obtained.
