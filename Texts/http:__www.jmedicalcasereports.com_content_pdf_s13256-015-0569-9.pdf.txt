Abstract 

Introduction 

Repair  of  contaminated  abdominal  wall  defect  in  a  geriatric  patient  is  a  challenge  for  the 
surgeon. We present the case of the oldest patient (105-years old) to successfully undergo a 
single-stage repair of a contaminated abdominal wall defect with a Permacol™ implant. 

Case presentation 

A  105-year-old  Caucasian  woman  presented  to  our  emergency  room  with  a  clinical  and 
radiological  diagnosis  of  small  bowel  obstruction  due  to  prior  operative  adhesions.  She 
underwent  laparotomy  with  small  bowel  resection  and  primary  closure  of  her  abdomen. 
There  was  total  eventration  of  her  bowel  through  the  suture  line  9  days  after  surgery.  She 
underwent  a  second  laparotomy  that  revealed  no  signs  of  peritonitis  or  turbid  fluid.  Her 
abdomen  was  closed  with  a  15×10cm  Permacol™  implant  sutured  sublay  with  prolene 
sutures. Her postoperative period was unremarkable. After a follow-up period of 3 years and 
2 months, there was no sign of recurrent hernia or wound contamination. 

Conclusion 

We  suggest  that  Permacol™  mesh  can  be  considered  an  efficient  alternative  to  primary 
closure or synthetic mesh in geriatric patients with contaminated abdominal wall defects.

Introduction 

The  reconstruction  of  an  abdominal  wall  defect  or  the  repair  of  a  large  ventral  hernia  is  a 
challenge  for  surgeons.  In  the  repair  of  clean  ventral  hernia,  the  use  of  synthetic  mesh  can 
lead to a 50% reduction in hernia recurrence [1]. However, the use of synthetic mesh in cases 
of  contamination  is  associated  with  serious  complications  such  as  fistula  formation, 
adhesions,  skin  erosion  and  increased  susceptibility  to  infections  [2].  Thus,  their  use  in 
contaminated  fields  is  associated  with  high  rates  of  morbidity  and  is  strongly  discouraged 
[3,4]. As a result, some advocate dividing definitive hernia repair into a two-stage approach 
[5,6]. The first  operation entails removal of the infectious source, and then the patient  must 
wait for 6 to 12 months before the second, definitive repair operation. For geriatric patients, 
however,  this  multistage  method  is  especially  problematic  as  most  of  them  have  numerous 
comorbidities.  An  operative  protocol  comprising  two  stages  separated  by  an  interval  of  at 
least  6  months  aggravates  the  risks  to  geriatric  patients  for  increased  postoperative 
complications. Recently, the treatment focus has shifted to bioprosthetic meshes that provide 
strength  and  that  promote  host  tissue  incorporation  and  infection  resistance,  which  together 
make  them  especially  suited  to  treatment  in  contaminated  fields  when  using  a  single-stage 
approach. 

Permacol™  contains  non-reconstructed  porcine  dermal  collagen  that  has  been  stabilized 
against  degradation  by  collagenase  while  retaining  its  elastin  content  and  flexibility  [7]. 
Recent case series have reported that Permacol™ is feasible and safe with the potential to be 
an  acceptable  alternative  to  prosthetic  mesh  in  the  repair  of  complicated  and  contaminated 
abdominal wall defects [4,8]. We present here our experience using Permacol™ mesh in the 
reconstruction of the abdominal wall of a 105-year-old patient with a 3-year follow up. To the 
best of our knowledge, this case is the oldest documented patient to undergo abdominal wall 
reconstruction with Permacol™ mesh. 

Case presentation 

A  105-year-old  Caucasian  woman  was  admitted  to  our  department  complaining  of  diffuse 
abdominal  pain  with  recurrent  vomiting  for  a  day.  Her  past  surgical  history  included  the 
repair  of  an  incarcerated  umbilical  hernia  3  weeks  prior  and  an  open  cholecystectomy  13 
years before. Her past medical history included ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation with 
a  cardiac  pacemaker  and  hypertension.  Despite  her  age,  she  was  clear-minded,  and  she 
managed to  fulfill  her daily activities in  her own home with  the help  of a nursing  assistant. 
On  physical  examination  her  abdomen  was  distended  and  tympanic  with  tenderness  in  the 
postoperative scar near her umbilicus. A computed tomography of her abdomen demonstrated 
small bowel obstruction. A midline laparotomy through the previous scar revealed numerous 
adhesions of the small bowel. During adhesiolysis, one small bowel loop was opened and a 
resection  with  primary  anastomosis  was  created.  Her  abdominal  fascia  was  closed  with 
polydioxanone loop and her skin was closed with tension nylon sutures. 

There was a total eventration of her bowel through the suture line 9 days after surgery. She 
underwent  a  second  laparotomy  that  revealed  necrosis  in  the  fascia  edges.  No  signs  of 
peritonitis or turbid fluid in peritoneal lavage were observed. Due to the fascial necrosis  the 
field was believed to be contaminated. As a result, fascial edges were resected and instead of 
using  a  regular  synthetic  mesh,  we  decided  to  close  her  abdomen  with  a  15×10cm 
Permacol™ implant (Covidien) sutured sublay with prolene sutures. Her abdominal skin was 

closed with several single nylon sutures, leaving an interval of a few centimeters between one 
suture and the next, due to contamination. After the second surgery, the postoperative period 
was  devoid  of  complications.  As  part  of  the  conservative  treatment  approach,  she  was 
gradually returned to oral nutrition that was accompanied by normal bowel movements. Her 
abdominal skin was closed with close nylon sutures 7 days after the second surgery, and she 
reported feeling well, with no fever. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender without any signs 
of surgical site infection. Discharged later that day, she returned to her house as clear-minded 
and functional as she was prior to her admission to hospital. 

During  a  follow-up  period  of  3  years  and  2  months,  there  was  no  sign  of  either  recurrent 
hernia  or  wound  contamination.  The  patient  reported  that  she  felt  good,  and  she  had  no 
complaints of abdominal pain. She died, 3.5 years after surgery, at the age of 108 of cardiac 
arrest  unrelated  to  the  abdominal  surgery.  For  clarification,  since  the  report  is  retrospective 
and  obviously  we  cannot  call  the  patient  for  a  follow-up  examination,  all  the  data  for  the 
follow-up was collected  from  medical  records, as the patient  was hospitalized several  times 
due  to  other  reasons,  not  related  to  the  surgery,  and  underwent  physical  examination  by  a 
doctor. 

Discussion 

Permacol™  is  a  porcine-derived  acellular  dermal  sheet  composed  predominantly  of  type  I 
collagen (93 to 95%). During the manufacturing process the cellular components are removed 
and  the  collagen  of  the  dermis  is  treated  with  hexamethylene  diisocyanate  (HMDI)  to 
increase 
treatment  also  promotes 
neovascularization and tissue ingrowth, thereby creating an environment that favors antibiotic 
permeation [10,11]. In addition, due to its smooth surface and a lack of foreign body reaction 
when implanted, Permacol™ mesh can be placed equally well in contact with the bowel and 
with adipose tissue. 

the  degree  of  cross-linking 

[9].  The  HMDI 

The use of Permacol™ in hernia repair was first  proposed in 1984 [12]. Subsequent  in vivo 
studies evaluating the different biologic meshes reported that Permacol™ is a safe prosthetic 
material  for  ventral  hernia  repair,  supporting  hernia  healing  by  strengthening  the  damaged 
tissue [13,14]. Catena et al. [8] reported a case series of seven patients, age range of 69 to 83, 
who were treated with Permacol™ for complicated incisional hernias. In a mean follow-up of 
11.1 months no recurrence or wound infection was observed. Another study [15] reported a 
case series of 28 patients ranging in age from 44 to 83 with acute and chronic abdominal wall 
defects, environments with potentially contaminated wounds, treated with Permacol™ mesh. 
They  described  three  recurrences  (15%)  in  a  median  follow-up  of  16  months.  Likewise, 
Loganathan  et  al.  [7]  reported  the  cases  of  15  patients,  age  range  36  to  76,  who  underwent 
repair  of  complex  or  recurrent  hernia  with  Permacol™,  some  of  the  patients  had  infected 
surgical  fields.  Two  recurrences  were  reported,  one  in  a  parastomal  hernia  within  30  days, 
most  likely  due  to  surgical  technique,  and  the  other  in  an  incisional  hernia.  Although  not 
clearly stated in the paper, the latter case was probably a late recurrence. 

In  spite  of  such  promising  results,  the  use  of  Permacol™  in  contaminated  surgical  fields  is 
still controversial. In fact, recent reports have cast doubt on those results. García-Pumarino et 
al. [16] reported a comparative in vitro and in vivo study of collagen meshes (Collamend®, 
Surgisis®  and  Permacol™®) 
in 
contaminated surgical fields. They reported that the collagen bioprostheses failed to show any 

the  polytetrafluoroethylene  mesh,  Preclude®, 

to 

bacterial  adhesion  or  bacterial  clearance  benefits.  In  addition,  Rosen  et  al.  [17]  reported  a 
large study of 128 patients, mean age 58.2±13.5 years, evaluating the long-term results after 
repairing contaminated abdominal wall defects with biologic meshes. Although the biologic 
meshes that were tested (Strattice™, AlloDerm®, Biodesign, XenMatrix™ and BioA) did not 
include Permacol™, and in our case the use of Permacol™ with a follow up of approximately 
3  years  revealed  no  signs  of  hernia  recurrence,  this  finding  still  raises  the  question  of  the 
long-term  efficacy  of  Permacol™.  For  clarification,  recently  studies  report  favorable 
outcomes with synthetic mesh in a contaminated ventral hernia [18]. However, their usage in 
a contaminated field is not yet a standard of care, and due to this controversial issue the use 
of a biological mesh is still a reasonable and effective technique. 

While  the  general  issue  of  abdominal  wall  repair  in  the  presence  of  contamination  is 
controversial,  it  becomes  even  more  complicated  for  geriatric  patients,  who  often  have 
multiple  comorbidities.  This  situation  precludes  the  use  of  a  two-stage  surgical  procedure 
with  geriatric  patients,  in  whom  the  potential  increase  in  operative  risk  is  unacceptable. 
Moreover, the high rates of pulmonary diseases in these patients rule out the use of a direct 
suture,  which  will  increase  intra-abdominal  pressure,  thereby  influencing  respiratory 
dynamics [19]. 

Based on the literature reviewed here, we decided in our case of a 105-year-old patient with 
bowel  eventration  to  repair  her  abdominal  wall  defect  with  Permacol™  mesh.  Over  the 
course  of  a  follow-up  period  of  3  years  and  2  months,  we  did  not  observe  any  sign  of 
recurrent  hernia or long-term  infectious  complications.  In  addition  to  the  surgical  technique 
of using a biological mesh, we must mention that it was a combination of better perioperative 
care and preoperative preparation (especially in a geriatric patient) that were the basis of the 
successful treatment. 

Conclusions 

The repair of a contaminated abdominal wall defect in a geriatric patient is a challenge for the 
surgeon. Due to  their high  cost  and the fear of postoperative complications, many  surgeons 
decide not to use a biological mesh in a geriatric patient. We present the case of the oldest, to 
the best  of our knowledge, patient  (105-years old) to  have successfully  undergone  a single-
stage  repair  using  a  Permacol™  implant.  We  suggest  that  Permacol™  mesh  can  be 
considered  an  efficient  alternative  to  primary  closure  or  synthetic  mesh  in  geriatric  patients 
with contaminated abdominal wall defects.
