Bleeding and thrombosis in a patient with
primary antiphospholipid syndrome using
norethisterone: a case report

Open Access

Abstract

Introduction: Antiphospholipid syndrome is known to be associated with the occurrence of venous and/or arterial
thrombosis. There are several factors that might trigger the risk of thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome,
including drugs, however bleeding is rare. Only a few cases of antiphospholipid syndrome have reported
simultaneous bleeding and thrombosis, and only a few of these cases have reported thrombosis induced by
norethisterone when used by patients with an underlying risk factor for thromboembolism.
Case presentation: We report the case of a 35-year-old Saudi woman diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome
with a history of several spontaneous miscarriages and two previous lower limb deep vein thromboses. She had
used norethisterone to postpone her menstruation and presented to our institution with severe menorrhagia. During
admission, she developed thrombocytopenia, and at the same time she was found to have extensive inferior vena cava
and bilateral common iliac thrombosis.
Conclusions: This case report is of interest to rheumatologists, hematologists and radiologists because we have found
that the presence of bleeding and thrombocytopenia do not preclude the concomitant occurrence of thrombotic
complications of antiphospholipid syndrome. Norethisterone is normally safe to take, but it is not suitable for patients
with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Also, the simultaneous management of thrombosis and heavy vaginal
bleeding is a challenge for clinicians since there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the management of these
patients.

Introduction
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined by two
major components: the occurrence of at least one clin-
ical feature, venous or arterial thrombosis and/or preg-
nancy morbidity, and the presence of at least one type of
autoantibody known as an antiphospholipid antibody
((aPL), detected by lupus anticoagulant tests, anticardio-
lipin and/or anti-β2 glycoprotein-I antibodies on two
separate occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. Other aPLs,
such as antibodies to prothrombin, annexin V, phospha-
tidylserine and other proteins, have also been associated
with APS. However, the understanding of the potential
roles played by such antibodies in APS is incomplete,

and assays for these antibodies are not a part of the
standard evaluation when APS is suspected. Antibodies
to prothrombin are associated with bleeding and throm-
bosis [1]. Thrombosis is the most common clinical mani-
festation of APS, and the recurrence of thrombotic events
is common as well. Thrombosis in APS can happen either
spontaneously or with a triggering factor. Another com-
mon clinical manifestation of APS is thrombocytopenia
[2], but this does not preclude the occurrence of throm-
botic complications of APS. It is common to treat throm-
bosis associated with APS, but it is quite difficult to treat
thrombosis and bleeding at the same time. In the litera-
ture, only a few cases of APS have reported simultaneous
bleeding and thrombosis [3-8], and only a few of these
cases have reported thrombosis induced by norethisterone
when used by patients with an underlying risk factor for
thromboembolism [9].

Norethisterone contains a hormone similar to the proges-
togen hormone produced naturally in the body. Despite the
number of menstrual cycle disorders on its licensed indica-
tions [10], norethisterone is prescribed by most clinicians
to stop heavy menstrual bleeding events [11]. Before 1999,
it was thought that high-dose norethisterone was free of
serious adverse effects, but two studies have revealed an in-
creased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
women taking high-dose oral progestogens, either because
progestogen increased VTE risk or because these women
had an underlying risk of VTE [11]. These risk factors have
been added to the contraindications of norethisterone [12,13].

Case presentation
We report the case of a 35-year-old Saudi woman, living
in the Eastern Province; a three-hour drive from our hos-
pital. She was a house wife, married for 12 years, with no
children. When she was admitted to our hospital, she was
complaining of abdominal pain for 10 days and menor-
rhagia for five days. She was first seen at our hospital’s
rheumatology department three months prior to her ad-
mission, and was diagnosed at her local hospital with
APS five years prior to her presentation. During her
follow-up visits at her local hospital she had two deep
vein thromboses (DVTs). The first was of her proximal
right lower limb, for which she received heparin followed
by warfarin, and the second was of her distal right lower
limb. As she was two-and-a-half months pregnant at the
time of her second thrombosis, she was given enoxaparin
subcutaneously. She had a history of nine miscarriages
over 12 years, all at a gestational age of one-and-a-half to
two-and-a-half months. In her first to fifth pregnancies,
she was not receiving any anticoagulation treatment, but
she did receive anticoagulation treatment during subse-
quent pregnancies, and 81mg of aspirin per day. She also
had a history of arthralgia, fatigue and thrombocytopenia
four years previous, with a platelet count of 45 to 50×103.
However, there was no history of mouth ulcer, skin rash,
photosensitivity, renal disease or convulsion, or any other
medical illness.

At 13 days before her admission, she was planning to
travel, prior to which she started using norethisterone
(oral progestogen) 5mg two to three times per day to
delay her menses during the trip. The medication was
not prescribed to her by a physician, nor did she discuss
it with any physician before she started using it; rather
she bought the drug herself. Three days after her arrival
to her destination, which is two hours away by airplane,
she developed abdominal pain mainly in the epigastric
area, in the form of cramps, associated with nausea and
vomiting, but she had no hematemesis and no presenta-
tion of diarrhea or fever. During that time, she stopped
taking norethisterone, which she had been using for a
total of 15 days, and started having severe vaginal bleeding

with clots. Because of these symptoms she interrupted her
vacation and returned to Saudi Arabia, where she was ad-
mitted to her local hospital for three days. She left her
local hospital against medical advice, to be admitted to
our hospital. Her social history revealed that because of
her inability to have children, her husband was consider-
ing having another wife, which was a cause of stress.

During her examination she was conscious, oriented,
pale and not jaundice. Her temperature was 37°C, her
pulse rate was 120 per minute, her blood pressure was
120/80 and her respiratory rate was 22 breaths per mi-
nute. Her abdomen was soft, but only tender at the epi-
gastric and the right upper quadrant. Her lower limbs
showed no signs of DVT and her other systemic exami-
nations were normal.

Table 1 shows the baseline lab tests at her first presen-
tation. Her iron levels were at 140ug/dL (normal level:
37 to 145), which suggested possible α thalassemia. Even
though she was currently receiving warfarin, her PTT
levels were still high (PTT = 123.4 seconds (control 34)),
suggesting the presence of
lupus anticoagulant. She
showed a mild positive resistance to activated protein C
(APC-resistance ratio of 0.76, normal levels are between
0.8 and 1.1), which may have been due to anticoagula-
tion. Lupus anticoagulant, protein C and protein S tests
were not done because she was already on warfarin.

Table 2 shows the tests conducted on her first day of
admission. She had an acute drop from her baseline
hemoglobin level to 6.6g/dL. Coagulation studies dem-
onstrated a markedly prolonged PT of 173 seconds and
INR of 8.36 seconds, and PTT with no clotting. Her
peripheral blood film showed microcytic, hypochromic
red blood cells with normal white blood cells count,
however her platelets were decreased and marked
platelet anisocytosis was seen. Her repeat peripheral
blood film conducted on 7 June 2011 showed marked ani-
socytosis with microcytes, occasionally fragmented forms,
neutrophilic leukocytosis and marked thrombocytopenia.
Table 3 shows the repeated complete blood count, coagu-
lation profile and renal function tests during the patient’s
subsequent admission days and three months after her
discharge. The tests showed leukocytosis which responded
to antibiotics. The tests also showed thrombocytopenia,
which improved with intravenous immunoglobulin and
methylprednisolone.

The initial diagnosis was APS, gastritis or food poisoning,
with menorrhagia and anemia secondary to withdrawal of
norethisterone in a patient using warfarin.

During admission, she received a total of four units of
packed red blood cells and four units of fresh frozen
plasma. She also became febrile, with a temperature of
38.8°C. On the second day of admission, she was started
on 60mg of enoxaparin administered subcutaneously
every 12 hours, 3mg of warfarin once per day (on the

to INR), a course of an antibiotic (ceftriaxone), 20mg of
omeprazole per day and butylscoplamine bromide for
upper abdominal pain. Her previous medications were
continued, which consisted of hydroxychloroquine 200mg
twice per day, calcium carbonate and vitamin D. She had
had no vomiting since her admission, but continued to
complain of upper abdominal pain in the following days,
in spite of receiving different analgesics. Her abdomen
continued to be soft, and only tender at the epigastric and

the right upper quadrant. Her upper gastrointestinal en-
doscopy revealed moderate erosive gastritis, which could
not explain her pain. Her pelvic and abdominal ultrasound
only showed mild hepatomegaly, but was otherwise nor-
mal. Her Doppler abdominal ultrasound showed no ven-
ous thrombosis.

At that stage, it was suspected that there was a psycho-
logical contribution to her expression of pain, which was
suspected due to her social history. However, investiga-
tions were continued by conducting a triphasic abdominal

hepatomegaly with multiple small ill-defined hypodensi-
ties predominantly
and
sub-diaphragmatic region. These are shown in the con-
trast-enhanced CT scans in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4. The radi-
ologist identified those lesions as an infarct secondary to
vasculitis. The inferior vena cava (IVC) was narrowed in
the subhepatic region and showed a filling defect in the
distal segment, which extended into the right and left
common iliac and external iliac veins, with prominent
azygos. Her bilateral lower limb venous Doppler ultra-
sound showed no abnormality.

On her sixth day of admission a dose of 1g per day of
intravenous methylprednisolone was given for three
days, followed by 60mg per day of oral prednisolone.
She also received 0.4g/kg per day of intravenous im-
munoglobulin (IVIG) for four days. Later on, the enoxa-
parin was stopped, and the warfarin dose was adjusted

according to the INR. Her vaginal bleeding was initially
heavy with clots, but it gradually decreased until it
stopped completely. After she was discharged, the
oral prednisolone was tapered gradually. Her previous med-
ications were continued, which included warfarin,81mg
aspirin,hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice per day, calcium
carbonate and vitamin D.

The final diagnosis was APS, menorrhagia, anemia and
venous thrombosis, possibly triggered by norethisterone.
Her outpatient department (OPD) follow-up visit showed
that she was doing well. Her follow-up abdominal tripha-
sic CT scan was conducted three months later, which
showed only two hypodense lesions in the liver, which
were most likely fatty infiltration or infarction areas. The
inferior vena cava showed partial thrombosis in the infra
renal area. Her CT scan also showed a dilation of the
superficial abdominal veins, and a partial opacification of
the common iliac veins, the external and the internal
iliac veins. The right common iliac vein was narrowed
with a central filling defect, and the left common iliac
vein was dilated with a thrombus attached to the wall.
These are shown in the contrast-enhanced CT scans in
Figure nine. The contrast-enhanced CT scans are shown
in Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.

Discussion
aPLs are known to be associated with the occurrence of
venous and/or arterial thrombosis. However, bleeding is
rare in cases of APS [14]. Our patient was diagnosed
with APS, with a recent history of norethisterone use,
who was admitted to our hospital with severe menorrha-
gia. During admission, she developed thrombocytopenia
and was found to have extensive IVC and bilateral com-
mon iliac thrombosis, which made the course of treatment
challenging because it is difficult to use anticoagulation in
a patient with heavy bleeding. Only a few cases of APS
have reported simultaneous bleeding and thrombosis
[3-8], and only a few of these cases have reported
thrombosis induced by norethisterone when used by
patients with an underlying risk factor for thrombosis [9].
APS is an autoimmune multisystem disorder of recur-
rent thrombosis and/or pregnancy losses that is associated
with the presence of aPLs [2]. Primary antiphospholipid
syndrome (PAPS) is the most common cause of acquired
thrombophilia and accounts for 15 to 20% of all episodes
of DVT [2]. All sites of the vascular bed may be subjected
to thrombosis, large, medium and small, but the most
common site is the deep venous system of the lower limbs
and pulmonary embolism. Other reported sites of venous
thrombosis include the pelvic, renal, mesenteric, portal,
hepatic, axillary, sagittal veins and IVC [2]. There are sev-
eral factors that may trigger the risk of thrombosis in APS
including infection, trauma, surgery, withdrawal of oral
anticoagulation [15] and drugs such as oral contraceptive

pills. In this case study, thrombosis was possibly triggered
by drug use (norethisterone). In women with previous or
current thrombosis or an underlying risk of thrombo-
embolism, when considering the use of norethisterone,
the benefits of treatment need to be carefully weighed
against the risks. If VTE develops after initiating ther-
apy, the drug should be discontinued [13].

In patients with venous occlusive disease and recurrent
fetal loss, testing for protein C, protein S and antithrombin

III deficiency or the factor V Leiden and prothrombin mu-
tation should be conducted according to the economics,
test availability and the clinical likelihood. It is also useful to
test patients with arterial occlusive disease for hyperhomo-
cysteinemia [14]. In this case, our patient fulfilled the cri-
teria for APS, making conducting these tests nonessential.
Protein C and protein S tests were not conducted because
she was on warfarin. Her tests for antithrombin III de-
ficiency showed normal results, with her mild positive

resistance to activated protein C (APC-resistance ratio)
possibly due to anticoagulation. As for the factor V
Leiden and prothrombin mutation tests, they were not
conducted because they were unavailable at the hos-
pital. Although there are no guidelines regarding monitor-
ing or measuring the anti-Xa levels when low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH) is used in patients with high
thrombotic risk, like our patient, it must be considered to
maintain therapeutic levels when available.

The treatment of acute venous thrombosis associated
with APS is similar to the treatment of other forms of
thrombosis. The treatment consists of anticoagulation
with heparin, either unfractionated or low molecular
weight, followed by warfarin, but then warfarin is used
for secondary thrombosis prophylaxis indefinitely with
the recommended INR of 2.5, while for recurrent throm-
bosis the recommended INR is 3 to 4. Other medications

have been also used in well-anticoagulated patients who
continue to have thrombosis, aspirin, hydroxychloroquine,
a statin drug, IVIG and plasmapheresis [14]. Hydroxy-
chloroquine has antithrombotic effects by inhibiting
platelet aggregation and arachidonic acid release from
simulated platelets [2]. Corticosteroids have no role in the
treatment of APS. However, high doses of corticosteroids
are usually given to patients with severe thrombocytopenia,
hemolytic anemia and catastrophic APS [14].

Bleeding is a rare manifestation of lupus anticoagulant-
antiphospholipid unless associated with coagulation factor
deficiency, severe thrombocytopenia less than 30x103/μL,
anticoagulation overdose or the presence of an acquired
prothrombin deficiency. Thrombocytopenia is a well-
recognized feature of APS. aPL-associated thrombocytopenia
is usually moderate without bleeding, and platelet levels

fluctuate usually in the range of 100,000 to 150,000/μL,
but are seldom low enough to be associated with bleed-
ing [2]. The pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in APS
is unclear. Hypotheses include the binding of aPLs to
platelet membrane phospholipid, B2-GPI/phospholipid
complexes or coexisting antibodies to platelet mem-
brane glycoproteins [2]. It was found that patients with
APS associated with SLE more frequently exhibited
thrombocytopenia than patients with primary APS (43
versus 21%) [2]. Thrombocytopenia does not preclude
the occurrence of thrombotic complication of APS [1].
The treatment of thrombocytopenia is the same for
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [15], which is cor-
ticosteroids and other medications used for steroid-
resistant thrombocytopenia, such as IVIG and danazol.

Also, splenectomy or rituximab have been used in pa-
tients with refractory thrombocytopenia.

One research has found a two to four-fold increased
risk of blood clots after plane travel due to low pressure,
high altitudes and lower oxygen levels. This risk increases
with the length of the flight, and patients with an under-
lying risk of thrombosis may be more vulnerable to distur-
bances in the clotting system during the flight. For our
patient, the flight did not significantly contribute to her
thrombosis because the flight was only two hours long
and her INR was closely monitored [16].

Conclusions
This case report is of interest to rheumatologists, hema-
tologists and radiologists because we have found that
the presence of bleeding and thrombocytopenia do not
preclude the concomitant occurrence of thrombotic com-
plications of APS. Norethisterone is normally safe to take,
but it is not suitable for patients with an increased risk of
DVT. Also, the simultaneous management of thrombosis
and heavy vaginal bleeding is a challenge for clinicians
since there are no evidence-based guidelines regarding the
management of these patients.
