Abstract

Introduction: Kleine-Levin syndrome is an extremely rare neurological entity characterized by recurrent episodes of
hypersomnia which are sometimes associated with compulsive hyperphagia and behavioral changes. Autoimmunity
has recently been proposed as a factor contributing to its pathogenesis. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a
relatively common autoimmune disease showing a lot of complexity and uncertainty regarding its treatment
regimens and its refractory nature in some cases.
Case presentation: A 32-year-old Persian White man visited his private hematologist complaining of recent episodes
of epistaxis and appearance of petechial lesions 24 hours after receiving a meningococcal vaccine. He had a history of
immune thrombocytopenic purpura 13 years before his presentation. Based on his history and laboratory findings, his
condition was diagnosed as a relapse of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and was managed accordingly. He did
not respond to first-line corticosteroid regimens and later developed neurological symptoms as recurrent episodes
of hypersomnia and hyperphagia. After a complete clinical and paraclinical evaluation and ruling out other possible
conditions, he was given a diagnosis of Kleine-Levin syndrome. He was followed up for his immune thrombocytopenic
purpura and received different treatment regimens none of which were adequately successful except intravenous
immunoglobulin that was only temporarily effective. He has had 4 documented self-limited episodes of Kleine-Levin
syndrome since his initial presentation.
Conclusions: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura may be associated with meningococcal vaccination in adulthood.
Responses to treatment in immune thrombocytopenic purpura vary among patients. Our patient only had a transient
acceptable response to intravenous immunoglobulin while all other options failed to improve his platelet count.
Concurrence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and Kleine-Levin syndrome supports the role of autoimmunity as
the proposed pathophysiological mechanism of Kleine-Levin syndrome.

Introduction
Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a very rare neurological
disorder characterized by relapsing-remitting periods of
hypersomnia which are sometimes associated with com-
pulsive hyperphagia and abnormal behavioral changes.
Although mainly affecting male adolescents, the disease
has been reported among people at a range of 4 to 82

years of age [1,2]. No population-based studies are avail-
able regarding its prevalence. Nevertheless, 186 cases of
KLS have been reported worldwide according to the lat-
est systematic review of cases published in 2005 only
three of which were from Iran. The factors triggering
the onset of the disease remain to be elucidated, while a
number of precipitating factors have been reported in
the literature the most common of which is a preceding
infection such as a flu-like illness, an upper respiratory
tract infection, a nonspecific fever, or a summer gastro-
enteritis with the symptoms occurring 3 to 5 days

following the onset of fever or infection. Its occurrence
has also been reported following consumption of alco-
hol or marijuana for the first time or in large amounts [3].
There are some hypotheses explaining the pathogenesis of
KLS one of which is a post-infectious and autoimmune re-
action affecting the thalamus, hypothalamus, and frontal,
temporal, or occipital lobes of the brain [3-5]. Some re-
searchers have recently focused on the autoimmune fac-
tors underlying the pathogenesis of KLS including specific
associated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types [6].

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a rela-
tively common autoimmune hematological disorder with
a predilection for young women over men. Its pathogen-
esis involves both platelet destruction and impaired
platelet production both of which are mediated by the
immune system [7,8]. It can occur in isolation or with
other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus ery-
thematosus. It has also been reported to occur follow-
ing the administration of certain drugs and vaccines
[9-11]. The goal of the treatment is to increase the
platelet count to prevent bleeding events associated
with thrombocytopenia [7]. Treatment with immuno-
modulatory agents remains the main component of the
treatment although many cases have recently been re-
fractory to such drug regimens [12]. A majority of chil-
dren with ITP recover spontaneously while in adults it
follows a more persistent course and often requires
more rigorous medical interventions [13].

In this case report we describe a 32-year-old man with a
chronic refractory ITP who developed symptoms suggest-
ive of KLS early in the course of ITP. This concurrence
of diseases together with the autoimmune background of
ITP and the factors inducing their initiation may intro-
duce areas of further research on the pathophysiological
background of KLS. Moreover the occurrence of KLS at
this age is exceptionally rare according to the literature
[6,14]. This case has many unique educational aspects re-
garding the course of ITP including the triggers that can
potentially play a role in its relapse.

Case presentation
A 32-year-old Sistani-Persian White man presented to a
hematologist for the recent appearance of petechial le-
sions and epistaxis. He mentioned a history of ITP 13
years prior to his visit which had not responded well
to standard corticosteroid therapy, was managed with
splenectomy after 3 months of resistance to steroids and
had remitted since that time until the recent reappear-
ance of symptoms. He also reported having had pharyn-
gitis 2 weeks before his current symptoms onset that
had not been improved by amoxicillin-clavulanate ad-
ministration. He also reported a history of recent menin-
gococcal vaccination and stated that his symptoms had
started within 24 hours after meningococcal vaccination.
The laboratory results showed a platelet level of 25,000
per microliter. With a diagnosis of relapsing ITP, he was
started on standard prednisolone regimen for 1 month
which did not improve his condition. After 2 months he
was seen by another hematologist for further evaluation
and persistence of thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow bi-
opsy was performed which confirmed the diagnosis of ITP
(Figure 1). He also underwent a scan for accessory spleen
which was negative. Following this visit, he was given
40mg/day of pulsed dexamethasone for 4 days every 2
weeks for 8 weeks in addition to pulsed rituximab (800U/
week) for 4 cycles neither of which was sufficiently effect-
ive to reduce his symptoms. Detailed information regard-
ing his medication history following this visit is presented
in Table 1.

Twenty months after relapse of ITP, when our patient
was taking sirolimus, he presented to our hematology
clinic again with sudden onset of new symptoms including
hypersomnia, abnormal behavioral changes, clumsiness,
and compulsive hyperphagia. His wife reported that her
husband slept approximately 20 hours a day during his
symptomatic period, did not wake up spontaneously ex-
cept for voiding and could not be awakened upon calling
on him. She also recounted that her husband had drunk
coffee the night before his onset of symptoms. Compu-

ted tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of his brain and spinal cord were unre-
markable; his symptoms improved spontaneously, thus
he was discharged. It continued this way until recur-
rence of neurologic symptoms 3 months later in tem-
poral association with a thrombocytopenic attack with
a platelet count of 12,000. During these episodes, he was
hospitalized and given two doses of intravenous immuno-
globulin (IVIG) and steroids resulting in a temporary im-
provement. He was referred to our neurology department
for consultation.

On evaluation at our neurology department, he was
amnesic about details of events during his symptomatic
periods. His wife though described the last attack as
around 18 to 20 hours of daily sleep during which time
he woke up spontaneously two to three times and could
be awakened by calling on him. She also reported exces-
sive food intake by her husband (seven to eight complete
meals a day) during the recent episode with a much
stronger tendency for sweet foods. She stated that her
husband had delayed ejaculation during his sexual inter-
course and mentioned the length of each episode of
neurological symptoms as one to two weeks.

His medical history apart from ITP was only signifi-
cant for malaria during his childhood which had been
managed successfully. He denied any history of narco-
lepsy, sleep disorders, or seizures. He is a Persian White
married man with one healthy son and lives in an urban
area in southeast of Iran. He did not use any illicit drugs,
drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. His detailed medica-
tion history is given in Table 1. His family history is not
significant for any neurological illnesses or sleep disor-
ders. His mother had an aortic incompetence which was
treated with surgery at the age of 45.

On physical examination, he was not ill or toxic and
appeared his stated age. His vital signs, head and neck,
chest, abdomen, genitalia, and extremities were normal.
He was alert, oriented to time and place, with mild psy-
chomotor slowness. His cranial nerves were intact and
motor tone, force and reflexes were normal. Pinprick,
light touch and vibration were intact. However, he was
found to have bilateral bidirectional nystagmus with cen-
tral pattern in the Hallpike test. He had an otherwise
normal gait apart from clumsiness and general slowness.
The differential diagnosis included episodic ataxia,
mood disorders, and metabolic encephalopathy inclu-

Amirifard et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports  (2015) 9:76

ding abnormalities of urea-ammonia cycle, Lyme disease,
Klüver–Bucy syndrome, and KLS.

A complete work-up including lumbar puncture was
conducted. Laboratory data including cerebrospinal fluid
study and liver and renal function tests were not signifi-
cant by any means except for findings related to the ITP
which was a platelet level of 25,000 per microliter and a
mild vitamin B12 deficiency. MRI and CT scans were
normal with no space-occupying lesions or signs of in-
flammatory lesions (Figure 2). Electroencephalography
did not show any notable pathological changes.

He experienced another episode a few months later
with similar symptoms although less severely with 12 to
14 hours of sleep every day and milder hyperphagia and
sexual disturbances but with nystagmus upon speaking
and a lag in gaze control. This resolved spontaneously
during the course of a few days as well.

After 2 months, he was referred to a referral hospital
in another city with single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) facilities for evaluation of brain
perfusion. He was given 40mg of dexamethasone daily

prophylactically 2 days before his flight. While boarding
the plane, he started feeling dizzy and had mild imbal-
ance and an abnormal gait. On the plane he slept the
whole length of the flight much to the surprise of his
wife as usually he never managed to sleep on a plane.
He was only awakened by his wife for dinner at which
time he ate both his own and his wife’s meals completely
and slept again immediately. He did not even wake up
after landing in order to get off the plane. He got better
after he left the plane and recovered over a course of 3
to 4 days when he underwent SPECT. SPECT results
were also completely normal and did not show anything
in favor of any specific diagnoses.

He was given a diagnosis of KLS supported by his nor-
mal laboratory and imaging studies and after ruling out
the above-mentioned conditions. However he was not
given any specific therapy for this diagnosis as he was not
concerned about the impact of the episodic symptoms on
his quality of
life. His platelet counts remain below
10,000/μL having only temporary responses to IVIG in the
acute setting.

Discussion
Relapse of ITP after splenectomy is a relatively rare
phenomenon involving less than 10% of patients initially
diagnosed with ITP which is scientifically categorized as
a refractory form of the disease [15]. Thrombocytopenia
may occur with an incidence of 1 in 25,000 to 40,000
vaccinations for measles, mumps, and rubella, and more
rarely after vaccination against pneumococcus, Hae-
mophilus influenzae B, varicella zoster virus, and hepa-
titis B, less than 10% of which evolve into chronic ITP
[16]. Our patient’s symptoms appeared within hours
after meningococcal vaccination. Although this does not
necessarily indicate an association between meningococ-
cal vaccination and relapse of ITP as the pharyngitis was
probably the main culprit, to the best of our knowledge,
this concurrence has not been reported previously in the
literature and is therefore of considerable value.

Idiopathic (immune) thrombocytopenic purpura is de-
fined as isolated thrombocytopenia for which other causes
have been ruled out. There are no established criteria for
its diagnosis. The American Society of Hematology re-
leased a guideline in 2011 giving evidence-based recom-
mendations aiding the diagnosis and management of ITP.
This guideline was largely based on the International
Working Group consensus panel [17]. These guidelines no
longer consider bone marrow examination a necessary
diagnostic measure and only recommend it in certain cir-
cumstances; instead, they suggest the diagnosis be based
on findings obtained from patient’s medical history, phys-
ical examination, complete blood count, and peripheral
blood smear. There is also insufficient evidence supporting
the use of laboratory tests such as antiplatelet antibodies,
antiphospholipid antibodies, and antinuclear antibodies for
initial diagnosis of ITP [18]. Our patient had typical signs
of thrombocytopenia, a positive past medical history of se-
vere ITP, a persistent platelet count of ≤30×109/L, and a
blood smear with suggestive findings, which fulfills the def-
inition of refractory ITP according to the guidelines which
define it as a severe ITP relapsing after splenectomy. We
also performed a bone marrow examination as the pa-
tient had no response to usual recommended medica-
tions which was consistent with the diagnosis of ITP as
well. Moreover, a transient response to IVIG by itself
prompts the immune pathogenesis of the underlying
condition and further verifies the diagnosis of ITP.

Treatment of ITP is only indicated in symptomatic
patients with platelet counts <30 to 50×109/L.First-line
therapy consists of corticosteroids, IVIG, and anti-D
antibodies. In patients unresponsive to these therapeutic
options, splenectomy may be indicated. Splenectomy is
considered the most efficacious treatment with 60 to
86% of patients going into complete remission postoper-
atively. A patient who does not respond to the first two
lines of therapy (25 to 30% of all patients with ITP) and

remains symptomatic for more than 1 year, as applies to
our patient, is classified as having chronic refractory ITP.
There is a predicament whether treatment should be con-
tinued and is of acceptable benefit in this group of patients
as current third-line drugs are mostly immunosuppressive
and may put the patients at risk of severe infections
[12,17]. Our patient fell into this group and considering
his symptoms and concerns and weighing out the risks
against benefits, we initiated the treatments as presented
in detail in Table 1. However, our patient did not respond
to the therapies suggested by the present evidence, includ-
ing immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents, ex-
cept for a short-term response to IVIG that made IVIG a
useful option in combination with corticosteroid pulse
therapy in the management of ITP in the emergency set-
ting. This finding is also supported by the literature, which
indicates that IVIG is at least transiently useful for emer-
gency management even in patients with chronic refrac-
tory ITP [12,17,18]. IVIG has also been shown to be
effective in other diseases of an autoimmune nature, one
of the earliest being its use in Guillain–Barré syndrome
and in our case was also effective in reducing symptoms
of KLS[19]. The new guidelines, however, also recommend
the use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists as one of the
options for treatment failure after splenectomy, which we
did not have access to in our center [18].

KLS is an exceptionally rare neurological disorder char-
acterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia which pri-
marily affects adolescents. Our patient experienced the
symptoms at the age of 32 and this is considered an even
more unusual phenomenon although the disorder has also
been reported at older ages [1,20]. The exact pathogenesis
of the disease is unknown as most of the clinical and para-
clinical findings are usually normal. However, hypoper-
fusion and other nonspecific abnormalities in the left
hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, medial and dorso-
lateral frontal and temporal regions have been reported
[4,21,22]. In the past 2 decades, autoimmune mechanisms
have been proposed as the culprits participating in its
pathogenesis. HLA-DQB1 has been reported to be associ-
ated with the disease in a controlled study on 30 patients
with the syndrome [5], although these results have not
been repeated in later studies [6]. Our patient developed
KLS against a background of an autoimmune disorder.
This finding may highlight the role of immunity in the
pathogenesis of this rare syndrome [1,14].

Of note, we had limitations on doing some of the rele-
vant paraclinical studies such as polysomnography, nu-
clear imaging during the episodes, and HLA typing due
to scarcity of resources and facilities at our center.

Conclusions
Our findings and other reported associations of some
vaccines with onset of ITP warrant the need for further

Amirifard et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports  (2015) 9:76 

Page 6 of 6

better quality research in this field and weighing out
their risks against their benefits in order to reach a con-
sensus on their risks and whether such vaccines should
be used more cautiously in patients more prone to ITP.

This presented case of refractory ITP suggests that
currently available treatments are not sufficient and that
new drugs such as thrombopoietin agonists may turn
out to be life-saving in such chronic refractory patients.
