Abstract

Introduction: Kawasaki disease is an acute necrotising vasculitis of the medium- and small-sized vessels, occurring
mainly in Japanese and Korean babies and children, aged 6 months to 5 years. Its main complication is damage of
coronary arteries, which has the potential to be fatal. Here we report a rare case of Kawasaki disease that occurred
in a 20-year-old Greek adult.
Case presentation: A 20-year-old Greek man presented with high fever, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, headache
and significant malaise. He had an erythema of the palms and strikingly red lips and conjunctiva. As he did not respond
to broad-spectrum antibiotics and after having excluded other possible diagnoses, the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease
was set. He was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and oral aspirin on the 10th day since the onset of the
illness. His clinico-laboratory response was excellent and no coronary artery aneurysms were detected in coronary
artery computed tomography performed 1 month later.
Conclusions: This report of an adult case of European Kawasaki disease may be of benefit to physicians of various
specialties, including primary care doctors, hospital internists, intensivists and cardiologists. It demonstrates that a
case of prolonged fever, unresponsive to antibiotics, in the absence of other diagnoses may be an incident of
Kawasaki disease. It is worth stressing that such a diagnosis should be considered, even if the patient is adult and
not of Asian lineage.

Introduction
Kawasaki disease (KD), also known as mucocutaneous
lymph node syndrome, is an acute necrotising vasculitis
of the medium- and small-sized vessels. It was first de-
scribed by Tomisaki Kawasaki in 1967. It occurs most
often in babies and children, aged 6 months to 5 years
and the male-to-female ratio ranges from 1.5–1.8 to 1.
KD is most prevalent in Japan, while Korea holds the
second place as to the number of patients. Its incidence
in Japanese and Korean children living in the USA and
following a Western lifestyle is higher than in Caucasian
children. Since the disease is not common in adults, es-
pecially in Europe, it is very often misdiagnosed [1-4].
According to a review in 2011, 91 cases of adult KD had
been described until that time [5]. Eight more cases have

been added to the medical literature since then [6-13].
To the best of our knowledge, our case is the 100th one.
It is the first described adult Kawasaki case not only in
Greece, but also in South-Eastern Europe (Figure 1).

Pathogenesis and genetics
The pathogenesis of KD is to a very large extent un-
known. A passive protection by maternal antibodies
could possibly explain the rarity of the illness during the
first months of life of an individual. An infectious cause
might be possible, since seasonal outbreaks, national epi-
demics, associations with tropospheric wind patterns
[14] and a self-limited course of the disease have been
observed [15]. Some studies point out that the trigger
for KD could be a bacterial superantigen [2,3] or a fun-
gal toxin [16]. The immune character is suggested by B
and T cells activation and cytokines production. More-
over, the severity of KD symptoms has been correlated
with the expression of THRIL, a long noncoding ribo-
nucleic acid involved in tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α

regulation [17]. Also of interest, a murine model of KD
develops a similar coronary arteritis after a single intra-
peritoneal injection of group B Lactobacillus casei cell
wall extract [18].

A genetic predisposition hypothesis is supported by:
i) noticeable differences in incidence rates among people
of various ethnic groups along with ii) a higher incidence
of KD among siblings of a patient compared to the gen-
eral population. Nevertheless, the genetic background of
KD remains mostly unclear. A series of polymorphisms
in a number of genes have been linked with increased
susceptibility for KD, with the most notable ones being
in ITPKC [19] and CASP3 [20]. Finally, the genetic loci
of FCGR2A, HLA, BLK and CD40 have also been sug-
gested as susceptibility candidates by means of genome-
wide association studies [21-23].

Diagnosis and complications
KD diagnosis is absolutely clinical since no specific diag-
nostic tests are available [5], although the proteins
meprin A and filamin C were recently shown to possess
potential as KD biomarkers [24]. The diagnosis is pos-
sible if an individual has persistent fever for more than 5
days, is unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, has
no proof of infection and four out of the five following
criteria:
iii)
cervical
iv) oral changes including
injected pharynx or lips, cracked or fissured lips, straw-
berry tongue; v) extremity changes starting with oedema
or erythema and then progressing to desquamation of
feet and hands, starting periungually [1,2,12,15]. Unfortu-
nately, these diagnostic criteria are valid for the diagnosis

i) polymorphous rash;
lymphadenopathy;

ii) conjunctivitis;

of KD in children, but have not yet been validated in
adults [5].

Coronary artery damage is the main and sometimes
fatal complication of the disease, being expressed as
aneurysm, calcification or stenosis [25,26]. Coronary ar-
tery aneurysms (CAA) can change with time: they may
regress, stay unchanged, progress to obstruction and,
rarely, rupture or expand [3]. If coronary abnormalities
are present, the diagnosis of KD can be set even when
less than four of the aforementioned criteria are met
[5,27]. Susceptibility to coronary artery lesions formation
has been associated in various populations with specific
single nucleotide polymorphisms in a wide range of
genes, such as ITPKC [19], IL-10 [28], TGFBR2 [29],
DC-SIGN [30] and KCNN2 [31]. Arteries other than the
coronary ones are also affected by the disease: a hepatic
artery aneurysm [32], a left humeral artery aneurysm,
with absence of flow in the antebrachial arteries causing
a peripheral gangrene [33], a proximal gastroduodenal
artery occlusion, and a mildly irregular splenic artery
associated with obstruction of
intrasplenic
the distal
branches [34] are described in the literature.

Systemic inflammation of many organs can occur. In-
flammation of the central nervous system would cause
typical meningitis [35] or just headache [2,8,32,36-43].
As to the myocardium and pericardium, KD may be the
cause of tricuspid regurgitation with vegetations [44], mi-
tral valve regurgitation with thickened mitral leaflets [45],
pericardial effusion [45], myocarditis [12,36] or heart
failure [12,46,47].

Clinical and laboratory findings concerning liver inflam-
mation are jaundice [32,40,48,49], hepatomegaly [15,32,50],

Kontopoulou et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports  (2015) 9:75

right upper quadrant pain [32,39], cholestatic hepatitis
[6,44,46-49,51], hepatic artery aneurysm [32], elevated
aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels [2,8,11,13,
33,34,40,41,43,52,53] and low albumin levels [11,40,53].
Mild renal failure, dysuria [6], as well as sterile leuco-
cytosis in urine analysis [11,15] can be manifestations of
renal involvement in KD.

The upper and lower respiratory system may also be
affected. Reddened pharynx [35,38-43,47-49,54], sore throat
[2,36,39,41,43,44,51,55-58], rhinorrhoea [43], mild non-
productive cough [39,43,44], dyspnoea [46],
laboured
respirations [32,48], rales [47], and acute respiratory dis-
tress [47] are symptoms often encountered.

The upper and lower intestinal tract are involved in
KD as well. Nausea [2,6,32,37,39,41,43,48,49,55,56,58],
vomiting [6,35,37,39-41,43,44,55], stomach cramps [48],
epigastric pain [47,49], dysphagia [34,40,51], abdominal
pain [39,40,51,58], abdominal tenderness [49], abdom-
inal distension [47], and diarrhoea [32,39-41,47-49] are
the main symptoms and signs.

The musculoskeletal system participates in the inflam-
matory process with various clinical representations: arth-
ralgia of the big joints [2,34,40-43,46,48,49,51,55,58] or of
the small ones [57], arthritis of the big joints [42], back
pain [39], hand and foot pain [39,41], painful synovial
thickening without effusion [32], joint effusion [2], joint
pain with or without motion [2,44], joints tender to palpa-
tion [51], and myalgia [27,36,43,49,51,53].

Lymphadenopathy is often observed in KD. It may be
mainly cervical [2,6,8,10,12,13,32-34,36,37,39,40,42,44,
46-52,55-58], but also axillary [33,36,40], inguinal [40,59]
or diffuse [38,41,43,45,54].

Skin and mucous membranes express a variety of abnor-
malities: skin rash [2,8,12,13,15,33-36,38-50,52-56,58]; skin
eruptions [12,36,41,51]; polymorphic erythema [6,10]; ery-
thema of palms and soles [15,34,40-42,45,48,51,54,55];
perineal erythema [12,35,36,40,52]; induration and swell-
ing of hands and feet [6,8,12,13,34,36,39-43,46,51,56,58];
desquamation of palms and soles [2,10,11,13,32-35,37,38,
40-47,49,57,59]; strawberry [10,13,32,35-37,40,41,44-48,
50-52,55,57,59], fissured [2] or coated tongue [15,48];
angular stomatitis [12,35,40,44,52]; mucosal ulcers [51,56];
erythematous [36,42,45,50,51,57], fissured [40-42,48,49] or
oedematous [8,11] lips; erythematous mucous membranes
[32,38]; mucositis of the urethra without discharge [41];
and icterus [47,49].

Eye problems are frequent and of great variety: con-
junctivitis [2,8,10-13,32-34,36-52,54,55,57-59]; iritis [37];
keratitis [34,52]; icteric sclera [32,47]; painful eyes [37];
palpebral oedema of the eyes [40]; and reduction of
vision [52]. As to the ear, tinnitus and mild bilateral
hearing loss have been reported [34].

Adult KD seems to occur more frequently in patients
with human immunodeficiency virus [5,37-40,42,50,58].

Diseases to be differentiated from Kawasaki are viral and
bacterial
infections, drug hypersensitivity syndromes,
toxic shock syndrome and autoimmune diseases with
idiopathic juvenile arthritis being a representative ex-
ample [2,5,25,27,60].

Treatment and long-term outcome
Ideal treatment for KD should be immediate administra-
tion, no later than on the 10th day of the disease onset,
of both immunoglobulin at 2g/kg once and aspirin at 50
to 100mg/kg for as long as the inflammation is present
[6,8,39,40,45,49,52,56]. Unfortunately, diagnosis within
10 days since the disease onset is set only in very few
cases [6,8,13,36,45,49,52], whereas treatment is given late
in others [2,15,37,44,50,51,55-57]. In a review in 2011,
only 15 out of 91 patients with KD were administered
treatment with both intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
and aspirin within the first 10 days of the disease onset [5].
Some patients received only aspirin [15,35,36,43,44,46-48,
51,55,57], while others were treated with IVIG only
[37,40,50,51].

Individuals who do not respond to the dual treatment
[2,3,6,12,42,61] have refractory KD and should be treated
with a second dose of immunoglobulin (2g/kg) [39,42]
and in non-responsiveness with high doses of corticoste-
roids,
tapered progressively until C-reactive protein
(CRP) regresses to normal levels [62]. A third [42] and
fourth [34] dose of immunoglobulin have also been re-
ported for relapses. Immunosuppressive factors, such as
anti-TNF, could be a potentially beneficial treatment
[3,26,27,63,64]. Treatment choices
in refractory KD
could also be plasmapheresis and thalidomide [42].

The long-term outcome of adults with a history of KD
without CAA is excellent
[2,5,13,15,34,36,39,40,43,44,
46-49,55,56]. Anticoagulation treatment should be dis-
continued after 6 to 8 weeks and a healthy lifestyle
should be adopted [26]. By contrast, patients with large
aneurysms (>6mm), regressed large ones or persistent
small ones are at high risk for developing stenosis or is-
chemia. They should be put on strong anticoagulation
therapy and lifelong follow-up [2,3,7,9,10,33,53,65].
These individuals have to be periodically tested with
echocardiography, stress tests, computed tomography
angiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Catheter-
based angiography, although invasive, may sometimes
prove useful [5].

Case presentation
A 20-year-old Greek man presented to our hospital
in late May of 2010 because of high fever (up to
40°C, unresponsive to anti-inflammatory drugs), ap-
petite loss, nausea and vomiting, persistent headache
and a feeling of significant malaise for 5 days. He
was diagnosed at a provincial hospital with an atypical

Kontopoulou et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports  (2015) 9:75

infection and had received azithromycin for 3 days, with-
out any improvement.

He had not travelled recently either within the country
or abroad. He denied intravenous drug use, new sexual
partners or tattoos. He had no animal exposure. He did
not use tobacco products or alcohol and had not taken
any medication. He was previously healthy. According to
his medical history, he reported allergic rhinitis and con-
junctivitis for his first 5 years of life, chickenpox at the
age of 5 years, a streptococcal pneumonia at the age of 6
years, several episodes of tonsillitis until the age of 12
years and a tonsillar abscess at the age of 11 years. He
reported no drug allergies. No contacts with similar
symptoms were identified. He had no antecedents of
Asian origin. The family history was non-contributory
and no family members had rheumatic diseases.

On admission, his temperature was 38.3°C, blood pres-
sure at 80/50mmHg, pulse was measured at 100 beats
per minute and blood oxygen saturation at 92%. A phys-
ical examination revealed bilateral conjunctival chemo-
sis, strawberry lips and tongue, dry mucus membranes, a
mild skin rash of his trunk, erythema of his thenar and
opisthenar regions of both palms, an oedema of palms
and soles and tachycardia with S3 and S4 gallop. Results
of examinations of his lungs, abdomen, neurological and
musculoskeletal systems were normal.

Laboratory findings (Figure 2A-F; see also the support-
ing data set [66]) revealed leucocytosis (13.2×103 per
cubic millimetre) with neutrophilia (91%) and left shift
with segmented neutrophils, anaemia (haematocrit 33%)
and normal platelets upon admission, which were later
elevated (Figure 2B). Acute phase reactants were ele-
vated: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 127mm 1st
hour; CRP, 30mg/dL and fibrinogen 761 seconds. Serum
creatinine levels and serum glutamic oxaloacetic trans-
aminase rates were normal, serum glutamic-pyruvic trans-
aminase at 80IU/L, alkaline phosphatase at 147IU/L,
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase at 67IU/L,
lactate de-
hydrogenase at 263IU/L, creatine kinase at 254IU/L,
bilirubin was normal, albumin at 3.1g/dL and sodium at
132mmol/L. Urine analysis was normal. Results of blood
and urine bacterial cultures and serological tests for bac-
teria and viruses were negative. Alpha 2 and gamma
immunoglobulin levels were elevated. All blood tests for
autoimmune diseases were negative. Immunophenotype
examination revealed reduced cardinal number of CD3
+CD8+ T lymphocytes. The results of a chest X-ray, an
electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram
were normal.

The patient did not respond to broad-spectrum anti-
biotic treatment. Desquamation of his fingers and toes
began on the seventh day since the disease onset.

Autoimmune diseases and juvenile idiopathic arthritis
were excluded, as he did not fulfil diagnostic criteria for
any of these diseases. Drug hypersensitivity reactions
could explain his clinical appearance; however, he was
previously healthy and there was no need for him to take
medication. Immediately after the suspicion of KD (on
the 10th day after the onset of symptoms), he was given
IVIG at 2000mg/kg once and aspirin at 50mg/kg orally
for the first 3 days, and at 100mg per day for another 3
months. His treatment was based on the diagnostic cri-
teria developed for KD in children because there had
been no validated criteria for adult cases of KD. Anti-
biotic treatment was discontinued at this time.

Immunoglobulin and aspirin had a striking result,
since the patient was afebrile and in better condition on
the very next day after the initiation of treatment. Dur-
ing the following days, all clinico-laboratory findings
gradually improved and only a reactive thrombocytosis
remained. In total, he remained hospitalised for 10 days.
A computed tomography coronary angiography performed
1 month later showed no coronary aneurysms. Today,
about 5 years later, our patient remains healthy.

Discussion
Our patient developed the disease in late May. Thor-
ough investigation for many infectious agents did not
prove an infectious source of the disease [2]. Neverthe-
less, he was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics for
7 days. This treatment was not successful and revealed
once more that an infection was absent, at least during
the patient's hospitalisation. Our differential diagnosis
covered a wide range of diseases, mainly infective and
autoimmune; none of them could be proved. Given that
his condition deteriorated and having no obvious diag-
nosis available, we performed an extensive review of the
current literature, focusing on his symptoms. KD, al-
though rare in adults, could explain the entirety of
symptoms and represent a diagnosis of exclusion. Treat-
ment began immediately on the 10th day of the illness,
due to suspicion of KD. This was fortunately in contrast
to the vast majority of reported adult cases of KD who
received treatment long after the 10-day period [5]. In
any case, the treatment that was administered would
have caused no harm to the patient, even if KD was not
present. It is worth noting that even with adequate and
timely administration – within ten days – of IVIG and
acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), 5% of patients develop coron-
ary abnormalities [26,62]. The therapeutic result of IVIG
supported the diagnosis of KD, since our patient’s condi-
tion improved considerably within hours.

Our patient did not have some signs and symptoms
that are more usual in adult KD, compared to that in
children, such as lymphadenopathy and articular in-
volvement. Lymphadenopathy is present in 93% of adult

cases of KD, compared to 75% of child cases. Joint prob-
lems are observed in 63% of adults with KD, versus 24
to 38% of children with the disease according to a review
in 2011 [9].

In contrast, our adult patient had persistent headache
that subsided only after the administration of IVIG and
ASA. Involvement of the central nervous system takes
place more often in children with KD (34%) than in
adults (10%) [5].

Our patient’s response to the treatment was astonish-
ing and extremely quick: fever resolved and his general
condition ameliorated within hours. Such a response is
not usual in the KD literature [54,39,40,56]. Most of the
patients become afebrile and feel better after 2 days
[6,8,33,44,45,51,52]; some others after 1 [13,35,39,59] or
3 days [11,50,58].

Laboratory findings consistent with KD were leucocyt-
osis with neutrophilia, anaemia, late thrombocytosis, ele-
vated ESR and CRP, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia,
elevated serum transaminases and gamma-glutamyl trans-
peptidase [27].

Other than a single IVIG administration and high
doses of ASA during the acute phase, no supplementary
IVIG or even corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents
were given, since no symptoms persisted or relapsed [5,62].
ASA was continued for 3 months after the acute phase as
an antiplatelet agent [26]. However, some studies suggest
immediate discontinuation of all medications after the
acute phase, in the absence of CAA [62]. Finally, long-term
follow-up was not needed, as no CAA were developed,
classifying the patient as risk level I [62]. He was only
advised of counselling every 5 years [26].

Conclusions
This case makes the point that a prolonged fever without
response to antibiotics should raise the physician's suspi-
cion of a possible KD incident, considering though its rare
occurrences in European adults. Prompt diagnosis and
timely treatment of this potentially fatal disease are the
keys that can save lives, preventing CAA formation.

Physicians of various specialties are involved either in
recognition or treatment of KD. Primary care doctors,
being the first to come across the patients, should trans-
fer them to hospitals at once. Hospital internists should
then set the diagnosis, according to the relevant criteria,
having first excluded other possible diseases. It is vital that
patients receive treatment with IVIG and ASA as soon as
possible and no later than 10 days since the onset of
symptoms. Cardiac complications and hemodynamic in-
stability may bring the need for transfer to an intensive
care unit, relegating treatment to intensive care practi-
tioners. Finally, cardiologists have the responsibility of tra-
cing long-term follow-ups, along with monitoring any
arising cardiac issues.

Future studies will hopefully shed light on the origins
and aetiology of the disease, allowing for more efficient
and targeted treatment and follow-up.
