Abstract

Introduction: Gas gangrene is most often caused by Clostridium perfringens infection. Gas gangrene is a medical
emergency that develops suddenly. The mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement than with involvement of
the extremities, which carries a better prognosis. With respect to vertebral involvement, there are few reports in the
literature. The purpose of this paper is to report a very rare case of vertebral osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene.
Case presentation: A 78-year-old Japanese woman with diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital with the
chief complaints of back pain, dysuria, and complete paralysis of both legs. A computed tomography scan showed
soft tissue swelling anterolaterally at intervertebral disc level T11/12 and a gas-containing epidural abscess that
compressed her spinal cord. Cultures later grew Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli. Hemilaminectomy was
done from T10 to T12, and an epidural abscess was removed. She went on to have fusion surgery 6 weeks after the
initial operation and subsequently experienced complete pain relief. She was discharged 2 months later, at which
time she was able to walk with a cane. Examination 18 months after surgery showed normal gait without a cane.
Conclusions: Discitis caused by gas gangrene infection was successfully treated by immediate debridement and
subsequent fusion surgery.

Introduction
Spontaneous gas gangrene is most often caused by a
bacterium called Clostridium perfringens [1]. Gas gan-
grene is one of the most fulminant infectious diseases; it
can cause myonecrosis, gas production, and sepsis. Pro-
gression of toxemia and shock is often very rapid. The
mortality rate is higher with trunk involvement than
with involvement of the extremities, which carries a
better prognosis [2]. Antibiotics alone are not effective
because they do not penetrate ischemic muscles suffi-
ciently [3]. With respect to vertebral involvement, there
are few reports in the literature [4-10]. The purpose of
this paper is to report a very rare case of vertebral
osteomyelitis caused by gas gangrene.

Case presentation
A 78-year-old Japanese woman with diabetes mellitus
was admitted to our institution with a 1-week history of
back pain and a 1-day history of paralysis of both legs.
She had been bedridden for a week prior to admission
in another hospital. There was no history of trauma. No
gastrointestinal symptoms were present. Her tempe-
rature was 36.8°C, blood pressure was 100/70mmHg,
and pulse was 103 beats per minute. On physical exa-
mination, her patellar tendon reflexes were present, but
Achilles tendon reflexes were absent. All sensory mo-
dalities were absent below the inguinal level. Her leg
muscles were completely paralyzed bilaterally. There
was no anal wink. Anal tone was diminished, and there
was no voluntary contraction of the external sphincter.

Admission laboratory values included a white blood
cell count (WBC) of 18,800 per mm3, her hemoglobin

was 9.4g/dL, and her hematocrit was 30%. Her Westergren
erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 80mm/hour, and
C-reactive protein (CRP) was 30.02mg/dL. Initial radio-
graphic examination of her lumbar spine at admission
showed only spondylotic change. A computed tomo-
graphy (CT) scan showed soft tissue swelling ante-
rolaterally at intervertebral disc level T11/12 and a
gas-containing epidural abscess that compressed her
spinal cord (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging
showed involvement of the T11/12 disc space and adja-
cent vertebral body with decreased signal intensity on
T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on
T2-weighted images with a gas-containing epidural ab-
scess (Figure 2).

The patient was urgently admitted to our hospital and
taken to the operating room for decompression and disc
debridement. Hemilaminectomy was done from T10 to
T12, and the epidural abscess was removed, followed by
T11/12 disc debridement. The epidural abscess was
yellow and turbid. Cultures later grew C. perfringens and
Escherichia coli. The wound was closed over subfascial
drains.

On the second postoperative day, she was confused,
and hydrothorax appeared. Thoracic drainage was
then performed by a surgeon. Intravenous antibiotic

treatment was begun with imipenem/cilastatin at 0.5g
every 8 hours for 2 weeks, followed by piperacillin/
tazobactam at 1.0g every 8 hours for 2 weeks, and
then ampicillin-sulbactam at 1.0g every 8 hours for
2 weeks.

Postoperatively, she experienced some sensory and
motor return in her legs, but back pain and left chest
pain in the sitting position continued. A CT scan 6
weeks after the operation showed T12 vertebral bone
destruction (Figure 3); her WBC count and CRP were
8800 per mm3 and 0.26mg/dL, respectively. She went
on to have fusion surgery with instrumentation and
subsequently experienced complete relief of her pain.
She was discharged 2 months later, at which time she
was able to walk with a cane. Examination 18 months
after surgery showed normal gait without a cane.
Plain radiograph at 18 months after operation showed
complete union between the T11 and T12 vertebral
bodies (Figure 4).

Discussion
Gas gangrene is divided into the following three types:
posttraumatic, postoperative, and spontaneous [11]. A
literature review reported that the spontaneous type ac-
counts for 16% of cases [11]. Spontaneous clostridial

myonecrosis is caused by C. perfringens and Clostridium
septicum in 60% and 30% of cases, respectively [12,13].
Clostridial species are commonly found in soil, dust,
water, and the intestines of humans and various animals
[2,14,15]. Without treatment, there is a 100% mortality
rate within 24 hours of onset of systemic symptoms [14].
If properly treated, the overall mortality rate is 20 to
30% [2,3,16]. The mortality rate is higher with trunk in-
volvement (50%) than with involvement of the extrem-
ities (24%), which carries a better prognosis [2].

With respect to vertebral involvement, favorable out-
comes after discitis caused by C. perfringens are obtained

if the infection occurs only within the disc [5,6,8,10].
However, with surgical site infection (SSI) after lumbar
spine surgery, one patient died, and one needed multiple
operations [4,7]. The differences in outcomes may be re-
lated to the amount of ischemic tissue. Although the
disc itself has a small amount of ischemic tissue and a
favorable outcome, the amount of ischemic tissue with
SSI is larger and is associated with a terrible outcome.
The present case with discitis and an epidural abscess
survived because the amount of
ischemic tissue was
small, and emergency debridement and antibiotic ther-
apy were effective.

Fusion surgery is needed if instability remains [17].
Stabilization with instrumentation is a safe and effec-
tive treatment for pyogenic osteomyelitis [18-21]. In
this case, even after her CRP level decreased,
the
patient could not sit because of her left lateral chest
pain. On CT, vertebral bone destruction had ap-
peared, and instability was considered the main rea-
son for her
lateral chest pain. We managed this
patient with posterior fixation with instrumentation.
She was treated successfully, and she was ambula-
