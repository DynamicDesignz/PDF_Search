Abstract 

Introduction 

The pain of acute herpes zoster (shingles) is severe and difficult to control. The medications 
used  to  control  pain  have  a  variety  of  important  and  potentially  serious  side  effects.  To  the 
best of my knowledge, this is the first case report of using a plain topical occlusive dressing 
to reduce the pain of herpes zoster, avoiding the use of medication. 

Case presentation 

A 40-year-old Caucasian man and a qualified physician (the author), developed a dermatomal 
vesicular  rash  consistent  with  herpes  zoster.  Applying  plain  topical  occlusive  dressings 
reduced the severity of his pain to an ignorable level. 

Conclusion 

Plain topical occlusive dressings provide effective pain relief for acute herpes zoster, thereby 
avoiding the risks accompanying medication use. 

Introduction 

I describe the case of a patient (the author) with acute herpes zoster (shingles), treated using a 
plain  topical  occlusive  dressing  to  reduce  the  pain,  thereby  avoiding  the  use  of  medication. 
The lifetime risk of acquiring herpes zoster (for unvaccinated individuals) has been estimated 
to  be  32%  for  women  and  22%  for  men  [1].  The  acute  pain  of  herpes  zoster  can  be 
debilitating  [2],  and  satisfactory  pain  control  is  difficult  to  achieve  [2].  Patients  can  have  a 
varied  pain  presentation  including  severe  pain,  hypersensitivity,  and  allodynia  (pain  in 
response  to  normally  non-painful  stimuli)  [3].  Currently  recommended  therapies  for  acute 
severe pain include non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, narcotics, prednisone, and gabapentin 
[2], all of which carry risks of a variety of severe side effects and complications. 

Some studies have evaluated the use of topical analgesia for the acute pain of herpes zoster. 
One uncontrolled study of lidocaine in petroleum jelly suggested a role for this therapy, but 
noted  there  were  a  large  number  of  practical  factors  in  applying  the  dressings  and  keeping 
them  on  that  limited  its  usefulness  [4].  Another  study  was  a  blinded  comparison  between 
patients who received aqueous patches containing lidocaine and other patients who received 

plain aqueous patches [5]. In this study, while there was some pain score improvement in the 
patients who received the plain aqueous patches, there was a more substantial improvement 
in those who received the lidocaine aqueous patches [5]. 

Case presentation 

The  author,  a  40-year-old  Caucasian  man  and  a  qualified  physician,  developed  a  ‘barbed-
wire-like’ painful left lateral thigh vesicular eruption in a dermatomal pattern. The rash had 
been preceded by two days of ‘electric, aching’  pain  without skin changes at  the same site, 
and occurred during a period of significantly reduced sleep due to an unexpected death of a 
sibling.  The  suspected  diagnosis  of  herpes  zoster  was  confirmed  within  four  hours  of  the 
vesicle  eruption,  at  an  urgent  care  centre,  and  a  seven-day  course  of  oral  valacyclovir 
1000mg, administered orally three times a day (GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, Canada), was 
started immediately, along with naproxen (Bayer Inc., Mississauga, Canada) and oral codeine 
(Ratiopharm, Toronto, Canada) for analgesia. 

The  codeine  and  naproxen  had  minimal  impact  on  the  severity  of  his  pain,  which  was 
constantly  present.  His  pain  was  further  aggravated  by  any  contact  with  the  affected  skin, 
including contact by clothing. Altogether, this pain constellation led to poor sleep, difficulty 
in concentrating, and increased stress during an already stressful period. 

In an effort to avoid increased narcotic use or additional medications (and their possible side 
effects), he elected to apply a series of plain occlusive dressings (Tegaderm™; 3M, London, 
Canada) directly over the vesicular eruption, as depicted in Figure 1. This decision was based 
upon a spontaneous hypothesis that an additional layer of skin (albeit artificial) might reduce 
the severity of his constant pain and skin hypersensitivity.

His pain reduced immediately to a tolerable (and ignorable) level, from approximately eight 
out  of  10  (with  codeine  and  naproxen)  to  four  out  of  10  on  a  numerical  pain  scale  (with  0 
being no pain and 10 being severe pain). More importantly, incidental contact by clothes and 
water  in  the  shower  no  longer  resulted  in  additional  severe  lancing  pain.  Subsequent  to  the 
occlusive  dressing  application,  no  more  analgesics  were  taken,  and  his  pain  level  never 
increased  above  four  out  of  10  on  the  numerical  pain  scale.  The  occlusive  dressings  were 
applied  for  the  duration  of  the  vesicles,  being  finally  removed  after  eight  days.  Peeling 
dressings  were  removed  and  replaced  during  this  period.  The  removal  of  partially  peeling 
dressings resulted in mild worsened pain at  the time of removal, akin to removing a regular 
adhesive  bandage.  If  replacement  was  delayed  for  longer  than  five  minutes,  his  previous 
severe level of pain would begin to return, and promptly returned to four out of 10 or lower 
with subsequent reapplication. Full resolution of his symptoms occurred over approximately 
two and a half weeks, with no post-herpetic neuralgia. 

Discussion 

The  intervention  described  here  is  an  attractive  option  as  it  removed  the  need  for  oral 
analgesia for the constant pain and hypersensitivity caused by herpes zoster. As a result, all 

potential  side  effects  and  potential  drug  interactions  of  oral  medications  were  avoided.  The 
occlusive dressing reduced his constant pain by half and greatly limited his hypersensitivity, 
bringing  it  to  a  tolerable  level,  allowing  resumption  of  regular  activities.  It  is  possible  that 
these occlusive dressings may work for other pain variants of acute herpes zoster, though this 
should be studied. 

It has been previously proposed that herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions may be treated with 
plain occlusive dressings, based upon a histological analysis that suggested HSV skin injury 
is  similar  to  partial-thickness  skin  wounds  [6].  The  same  rationale  has  been  used,  by 
extension, to support occlusive dressing use in the care of herpes zoster eruptions [7]. 

A  PubMed  search  did  not  reveal  any  clinical  therapeutic  studies  of  any  type  evaluating  the 
use of plain occlusive dressings for analgesia in this condition. However, in a blinded control 
study  by  Lin  et  al.  [5],  the  control  arm  was  an  aqueous  (non-active)  patch.  The  substantial 
pain  relief by the plain Tegaderm™ in  this case report was more in  keeping with  the better 
pain relief experienced by patients in the aqueous lidocaine arm of the study by Lin et al. [5]. 
It  is  possible  that  while  the  patch  itself  protected  the  skin,  the  aqueous  base  aggravated  the 
inflamed skin, thereby limiting the potential benefit of the physical barrier of the patch. More 
study needs to be done to see if the thin, plain Tegaderm™ dressings are equal in analgesia to 
lidocaine aqueous patches. 

A reasonable  clinical  management approach might  be to  recommend plain Tegaderm™ use 
(as  was  done  in  here)  and  ensure  patients  have  multiple  spare  dressings,  so  as  to  allow 
removal and reapplication when applied dressings become problematic (as a result of peeling, 
bunching,  or  water  interposition).  The  potential  reduction  in  acute  pain  severity  this  option 
provides (without the complications of traditional analgesia) to patients with herpes zoster is 
large, given the difficulty in achieving satisfactory pain control with usual therapy. 

Conclusion 

Plain  occlusive  dressings  may  provide  effective  analgesia  for  acute  herpes  zoster,  thereby 
avoiding the risks accompanying medication use. 

Patient perspective 

Herpes  zoster  was  most  unwelcome  in  the  days  immediately  following  my  sister’s 
unexpected death.  It  was a great  relief that  I had  an instant  reduction of pain  after applying 
the  Tegaderm™  dressings,  as  it  meant  I  could  then  focus  on  the  needs  of  my  family  and 
issues  related  to  her  estate.  It  was  months  later  that  I  fully  realized  this  was  an  important 
clinical finding to share.
