Abstract 

Introduction 

Polytetrafluoroethylene  is  ubiquitous  in  materials  commonly  used  in  cooking  and  industrial 
applications.  Overheated  polytetrafluoroethylene  can  generate  toxic  fumes,  inducing  acute 
pulmonary edema in some cases. However, neither the etiology nor the radiological features 
of  this  condition  have  been  determined.  For  clarification,  we  report  an  illustrative  case, 
together with the first comprehensive literature review. 

Case presentation 

A previously healthy 35-year-old Japanese man who developed severe dyspnea presented to 
our hospital. He had left a polytetrafluoroethylene-coated pan on a gas-burning stove for 10 
hours  while  unconscious.  Upon  admission,  he  was  in  severe  respiratory  distress.  A  chest 
computed  tomographic  scan  showed  massive  bilateral  patchy  consolidations  with  ground-
glass  opacities  and  peripheral  area  sparing.  A  diagnosis  of  polytetrafluoroethylene  fume–
induced  pulmonary  edema  was  made.  He  was  treated  with  non-invasive  positive  pressure 
ventilation  and  a  neutrophil  elastase  inhibitor,  which  dramatically  alleviated  his  symptoms 
and  improved  his  oxygenation.  He  was  discharged  without  sequelae  on  hospital  day  11.  A 
literature review was performed to survey all reported cases of polytetrafluoroethylene fume–
induced pulmonary edema. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and OvidSP 
databases for reports posted between the inception of the databases and 30 September 2014, 
as well as several Japanese databases (Ichushi Web, J-STAGE, Medical Online, and CiNii). 
Two radiologists independently interpreted all chest computed tomographic images. Eighteen 
relevant  cases  (including  the  presently  reported  case)  were  found.  Our  search  revealed  that 
(1)  systemic  inflammatory  response  syndrome  was  frequently  accompanied  by  pulmonary 
edema,  and  (2)  common  computed  tomography  findings  were  bilateral  ground-glass 
opacities,  patchy  consolidation  and  peripheral  area  sparing.  Pathophysiological  and 
radiological  features  were  consistent  with  the  exudative  phase  of  acute  respiratory  distress 
syndrome.  However,  the  contrast  between  the  lesion  and  the  spared  peripheral  area  was 
striking and was distinguishable from the common radiological features of acute respiratory 
distress syndrome. 

Conclusion 

The  essential  etiology  of  polytetrafluoroethylene  fume–induced  pulmonary  edema  seems  to 
be  increased  pulmonary  vascular  permeability  caused  by  an  inflammatory  response  to  the 
toxic fumes. The radiological findings that distinguish polytetrafluoroethylene fume–induced 
pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear 
sparing of the peripheral area.

Introduction 

Polytetrafluoroethylene  (PTFE),  or  Teflon®  (DuPont,  Wilmington,  DE,  USA),  is  ubiquitous 
in  materials  commonly  used  in  cooking  and  industrial  applications  owing  to  its  thermal 
stability and non-stick properties. However, overheated PTFE generates toxic fumes that can 
occasionally  cause  acute  pulmonary  edema  [1-16].  To  date,  neither  the  etiology  nor  the 
radiological  features of  PTFE fume–induced pulmonary  edema has been determined [1-16]. 
We therefore report an illustrative case and have conducted the first comprehensive literature 
review  to  clarify  the  etiology  and  radiological  features  of  PTFE  fume–induced  pulmonary 
edema. 

Case presentation 

A  previously  healthy  35-year-old  Japanese  man  was  admitted  to  our  hospital  with  dyspnea 
and  dry  cough.  He  had  fallen  asleep  while  leaving  a  PTFE-coated  pan  on  the  stove,  which 
caught fire. He awoke 10 hours later with severe dyspnea and noticed that the room was filled 
with white smoke. The PTFE coating of the pan was completely burned off, although the fire 
had  not  spread  outside  the  pan.  Upon  admission,  his  vital  signs  were  as  follows:  body 
temperature,  37.1°C;  heart  rate,  100  beats/min;  blood  pressure,  131/97mmHg;  respiratory 
rate,  30  breaths/min;  and  percutaneous  oxygen  saturation,  98%  (on  oxygen  10L/min  via  a 
non-rebreather  mask).  The  patient  was  alert  and  denied  using  any  medications,  including 
illicit drugs. Auscultation revealed bilateral  coarse crackles. His white blood cell count  was 
22,100/μl with 91.2% neutrophils, and his arterial oxygen pressure was 233.5mmHg while he 
was  on  10L/min  oxygen.  A  chest  X-ray  showed  bilateral  infiltration  (Figure  1A).  Chest 
computed  tomography  (CT)  revealed  massive,  bilateral,  patchy  consolidations  with  ground-
glass opacities and sparing of the peripheral areas (Figure 1B). These lesions were distributed 
in  a  dorsally  dominant  manner  (Figure  1B).  The  patient’s  echocardiogram  and 
electrocardiogram  were  normal,  so  a  diagnosis  of  PTFE  fume–induced,  non-cardiogenic 
pulmonary  edema  with  systemic  inflammatory  response  syndrome  (SIRS)  was  made.  The 
patient was admitted and treated with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) and 
intravenous sivelestat (Elaspol®; Ono Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan). NPPV was initiated in a 
setting of positive end-expiratory pressure of 8cmH2O and intravenous sivelestat at a dosage 
of 4.8 mg/kg/day, which dramatically alleviated his symptoms and improved his oxygenation 
on the day of admission. His respiratory status rapidly improved, and a second chest CT scan 
on  day  9  revealed  complete  resolution  of  the  infiltrates  (Figure  1B).  The  patient  was 
discharged to home without any sequelae on hospital day 11. 

Figure 1 Chest X-ray and computed tomographic scan obtained upon admission and on day 9 
of hospitalization. (A) Bilateral infiltration shadows were detected on admission (left), which 
had completely disappeared at day 9 (right). (B) On admission, bilateral patchy 
consolidations with ground-glass opacities and sparing of peripheral areas were found (left). 
On day 9 of the patient’s hospitalization, these shadows had completely disappeared (right). 

On 30 September 2014, we searched for all reported cases of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary 
edema  on  the  PubMed,  Embase,  Web  of  Science,  OvidSP  and  several  Japanese  databases 
(Ichushi Web, J-STAGE, Medical Online and CiNii), without language restriction and using 
the  following  keywords:  “polymer  fume  fever,”  “Teflon®,”  “polytetrafluoroethylene,” 
“pulmonary/lung  edema”  and  “acute  lung  injury/acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome 
(ARDS).” Three of the authors (RH, YO and RI) performed independent  screenings. Cross-

referencing was performed, and all the  relevant  case  reports and studies  were included. We 
excluded the following: (1) cases without evidence of pulmonary edema, (2) cases without an 
association  with  PTFE  fumes  and  (3)  academy  meeting  abstracts.  The  search  produced  121 
articles,  of  which  17  were  potential  candidates  [1-16].  Next,  clinical  features  including 
patient characteristics, the situation under which exposure occurred, symptoms, treatment and 
outcome  were  reviewed  by  three  intensivists  (RH,  YO,  and  RI).  One  report  was  excluded 
because of insufficient information [3], leaving 16 reports and 17 relevant cases [1,2,4-16] for 
inclusion  in  this  review.  The  temperature  of  the  overheated  PTFE  was  estimated  based  on 
information  in  the  relevant  reports  (molding  settings  [4,5,11],  cigarettes  [17]  and  an 
overheated pan [18]). SIRS was defined according to the criteria originally proposed by the 
American  College  of  Chest  Physicians/Society  of  Critical  Care  Medicine  Consensus 
Conference [19]. All CT images of PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema were interpreted 
independently by two chest radiologists (KK and TT). The distribution of the disease and the 
dominant  lesion  were  also  noted.  Thirteen  reports  without  CT  findings  were  excluded  [1,4-
14],  resulting  in  four  reports  [2,3,15,16]  and  eight  cases  ultimately  being  eligible  for 
inclusion in this review. 

The  clinical  characteristics  of  PTFE  fume–induced  pulmonary  edema  described  in  this 
review,  including  our  patient,  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The  patient  demographics  of  the 
cases in the literature review consisted of 16 men and 2 women, aged 21 to 59 years. Many 
patients  were  smokers  (12  of  18),  and  most  did  not  have  any  comorbidities  (15  of  18). 
Among  all  of  the  reports  included  here,  seven  cases  involved  exposure  to  PTFE-containing 
materials  in  factories  or  laboratories,  6  cases  were  of  patients  who  had  smoked  PTFE-
contaminated cigarettes and 5 reports described exposure to  fumes from overheating PTFE-
coated kitchenware in the home. Common symptoms were dyspnea (17 of 18), cough (12 of 
18) and flu-like symptoms such as fever (9 of 18) and chills (6 of 18). SIRS was frequently 
present  (10  of  18).  All  patients  had  evidence  of  exposure  to  fumes  developed  from 
overheated (391 to  875°C) PTFE. One patient  was exposed to PTFE fumes for 9 hours and 
died 5 hours after admission despite intensive treatment that included intubation [11]. Neither 
NPPV nor neutrophil elastase inhibitor was used in previously reported cases. Transbronchial 
lung biopsy was performed in one case, which revealed marked neutrophil migration into the 
alveoli with edema in the alveolar septa [12]. Table 2 shows the chest CT characteristics of 
PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema, including our patient. Four patients underwent chest 
CT on the day of admission: two on day 2 and two on day 4. Common findings were ground-
glass opacities (eight of eight), peripheral area sparing (six of eight) and patchy consolidation 
(four  of  eight).  With  the  exception  of  a  single  patient,  these  lesions  were  distributed 
bilaterally (seven of eight) and predominantly on the back in most cases (five of eight).

Discussion 

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  systematic  review  of  PTFE  fume–induced 
pulmonary edema. Because of the ubiquity of this material, all health care providers need to 
be  aware  of  the  characteristics  of  this  disease.  Our  search  revealed  that  (1)  the  essential 
etiology  can  be  inflammatory  pulmonary  vascular  hyperpermeability,  (2)  the  radiological 
features can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a patchy consolidation with clear peripheral 
area sparing and (3) the duration of PTFE fume exposure is a possible aggravating factor. 

First,  the  essential  etiology  of  PTFE  fume–induced  pulmonary  edema  can  be  inflammatory 
pulmonary  vascular  hyperpermeability.  Flu-like  symptoms  and  SIRS  frequently  accompany 
exposure, which are probably associated with pulmonary inflammation as a result of the toxic 
fumes.  In  one  report,  authors  described  the  transbronchial  lung  biopsy  findings  in  a  patient 
with PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema, revealing marked neutrophil migration into the 
alveoli with alveolar edema [12]. In a laboratory study, remarkable neutrophil infiltration and 
an increased level of inflammatory cytokines were found in the pulmonary lavage of rats that 
had  been  exposed  to  PTFE  fumes  [20].  Both  are  consistent  with  the  pathological  findings 
regarding  the  exudative  phase  of  ARDS.  NPPV  [21]  and  neutrophil  elastase  inhibitors  [22] 
are known to work effectively in treating disease of this etiology. 

Second,  the  radiological  features  of  PTFE  fume–induced  pulmonary  edema  can  be  bilateral 
ground-glass  opacity  or  patchy  consolidation  with  clear  peripheral  area  sparing.  Bilateral 
ground-glass  opacity  and  patchy  consolidation  are  consistent  with  the  chest  CT  findings 
regarding the exudative phase of ARDS, supporting the above-mentioned etiology. However, 
the  contrast  between  the  lesion  and  the  spared  peripheral  area  was  striking,  and  these 
characteristics were clearly distinguishable from the common radiological features of ARDS. 
One plausible explanation for the spared area is that it is more difficult for the toxic fumes to 
reach  the  peripheral  alveoli;  consequently,  this  area  escapes  inflammation.  The  other 
explanation is related to the characteristics of lymph flow in the lungs. Tiny particles in PTFE 
fumes  may  be  removed  by  the  lymphatic  drainage  system,  directly  or  by  means  of 
macrophage  ingestion  and  migration  [23].  The  lymph  proceeds  in  two  opposite  directions: 

centripetally in the center of the lung and centrifugally in the periphery [23,24]. Centrifugal 
lymph  flow  in  the  lung  periphery  may  effectively  remove  PTFE  particles  to  the  pleural 
lymphatics rather than centripetally by means of the lymph flow to the hilum [23]. Dorsally 
dominant infiltration can also be shown by the characteristic of the lymph flow in the lungs. 
Lymphatic  function  is  known  to  be  poorest  in  dorsal  lungs,  resulting  in  poor  clearance  of 
particles [23]. The above-mentioned radiologic features can be helpful in making a diagnosis. 

We  also  noted  that  a  temperature  of  approximately  400°C  may  be  the  threshold  for 
developing PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema in humans. Animal studies involving rats 
have  shown  the  development  of  lethal  pulmonary  edema  when  the  rats  were  exposed  to 
fumes  produced  by  overheated  PTFE  at  around  450°C  [25],  which  is  consistent  with  our 
findings. 

Finally,  the  duration  of  PTFE  fume  exposure  is  a  possible  aggravating  factor.  Lee  and 
colleagues proposed a dose–response relationship between PTFE fume exposure and disease 
severity  in  that  the  most  heavily  exposed  worker  (patient  2)  died,  whereas  less-exposed 
workers  (patient  3,  a  foreman  not  restricted  to  the  PTFE  room;  and  patient  4,  a  nightshift 
molder) recovered [11]. Our survey also supports this finding. Lesser-exposed patients, such 
as  those  whose  PTFE  fume  exposure  was  related  to  smoking,  recovered  quickly,  whereas 
more  heavily  exposed  patients,  such  as  our  patient,  required  longer  treatment  periods.  As 
discussed,  the  patient  who  was  exposed  to  PTFE  fumes  for  9  hours  died  despite  intubation 
[11]. In comparison, we successfully treated a similar patient (exposed to fumes for 10 hours) 
with  NPPV and early administration of a neutrophil elastase inhibitor, suggesting that these 
are suitable treatments for cases involving pulmonary edema of this etiology [21,22]. 

Conclusions 

Our  experience  with  our  patient,  as  well  as  our  literature  review,  suggest  that  the  essential 
etiology  of  PTFE  fume–induced  pulmonary  edema  is  increased  pulmonary  vascular 
permeability  caused  by  an  inflammatory  response  to  the  toxic  fumes.  The  CT  findings  that 
distinguish PTFE fume–induced pulmonary edema can be bilateral ground-glass opacity or a 
patchy consolidation with clear peripheral area sparing.
